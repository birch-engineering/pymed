The rationale for these treatments relies mostly on the drugs' ability to sterilize disseminated metastases (spatial cooperation) and on radiation-drug interaction for improved local control of the primary tumor. Supraadditive interaction, often resulting from impaired repair of radiation-induced sublethal damage, may lead to limiting toxicities. In contrast, pure additivity of the treatments may conceivably be turned to advantage because the dose-dependent response of cells to radiation includes a quadratic term. This is of concern, for example, to farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) of which six have already been tested in phase I clinical trials with most attention being paid to the non-peptidomimetic R115777. As one may expect a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect from FTIs, assays of combined modality treatment with cytotoxic agents applied in close temporal proximity should be performed. This prompted us to investigate the cells' response to RPR-130401 (Scheme 1), a non-peptidomimetic FTI issued from chemical optimization from series selected by random screening at Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer Co., both alone or in concomitant association with ionizing radiation.",

Together with mutation or deletion of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, mutations in one of the four Ras genes (H-, N-, KA- and KB-Ras) represent the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancers with predominance in pancreatic (90%), colorectal (50%) and lung (20%) tumors (for a review on ras mutations in relation to oncogenic transformation see). Activation of Ras proteins requires prenylation of the CAAX sequence at their C-terminus, to ultimately permit their association with other proteins or with the inner face of the plasma membrane. A key step in this process is catalyzed by farnesyltransferase (FTase). The K-Ras protein can alternatively be prenylated by type I geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase I), a closely related enzyme.",

Numerous inhibitors have been developed, including FPP analogs, CAAX peptide analogs, bisubstrate analogs and more recently GGTase I inhibitors. However, it is now known that a range of non-Ras proteins are targets for prenylation. In spite of this, the quest for specific FTase-targeting drugs that would not affect GGTase is still pertinent, because geranylgeranylation of normal cellular proteins is five to ten times more prevalent than farnesylation.",

RPR-130401 is highly selective (more than 300-fold) for FTase with regards to GGTase, an unexpected result since GGTase can accommodate and transfer both FPP and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to CAAX-motifs in proteins. Consistently, RPR-130401 efficiently inhibits Ras farnesylation in cells but does not block geranylgeranyl transfer to Ras. RPR-130401 is also very efficient in inhibiting lamin B farnesylation. The lack of protein substrate specificity is of particular interest for the development of this series of FTIs, as non-Ras farnesylated proteins may participate in transformation by Ras-dependent or -independent pathways. The discovery of prenylation-dependent oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatases harboring a CAAX-box strengthens the interest for such FTIs as RPR-130401.",

These observations correlate those made by other authors using Ras-mutated human pancreatic cells and L-744,832 or human lung cancer cells and FTI-2153. MiAPaCa-2 cells showed a similar response at low (1 x IC50) drug concentration. However, with this cell line both the G1 phase depletion and the increase in the ploidy number, were substantially less pronounced at high (10 x IC50) than at low (1 x IC50) drug concentration. Finally, with the exception of the pre-mitotic arrest, the effect of RPR-130401 on cell cycle progression and ploidy change was comparatively minor in A-549 cells.

MiAPaCa-2 cells showed a different pattern in response to RPR-130401 (Figure 5H,5H'). With these cells, lamin B was not strictly confined in the nucleus as indicated by cytoplasmic patches (Figure 5H).

Even though it results in an altered subcellular distribution of p21Ras, RPR-130401 is not able to block p21Ras geranylgeranylation in such a way that inhibition of p21Ras farnesylation is not likely to account for the main effects of the drug.

Indeed, protein isoprenylation is important at the G2/M transition in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and nuclear lamins are major targets for FTase. Lamin B farnesylation, which is a very sensitive target for RPR-130401 in vitro, appears to deserve consideration as a candidate to this role. As a matter of fact, among the three major type A-C lamins, lamin A and lamin B are initially translated with a CAAX motif. This motif is cleaved upon post-translational maturation of lamin A but persists in lamin B, unless the C-terminal aminoacid residue is mutated. Studies with mutant lamin deleted of the CAAX sequence have shown that the CAAX motif is essential to anchoring lamin B to the nuclear envelope; moreover, farnesylation is required for the integration of newly synthesized lamins into the pre-existing nuclear lamina during interphase, and GGTase is unable to substitute for FTase at this stage.",

This occurs in spite of significant hyperploidization, accumulation of cells in G2 and depletion of S phase. Finally, impaired repair of radiation damage by RPR-130401, appears to be very unlikely to occur. This seems valuable in the prospect of combining RPR-130401 as an adjuvant to conventional radiotherapy, as it should provide strictly additive interaction without the local and systemic adverse effects inherent in treatments with radiation sensitizers. In this respect it is very exciting to note that two farnesyltransferase inhibitors, FTI-276 and L-744,832, have recently proven to act synergistically with ionizing radiation in vivo for growth inhibition of xenotransplanted H-Ras-mutated human tumor cells, without increase in acute or long-term radiation-induced damage to healthy tissues.",
