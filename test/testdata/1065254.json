          "text": "Universal DNA base analogs having photocleavable properties would be of great interest for development of new nucleic acid fragmentation tools. The photocleavable 7-nitroindole 2'-deoxyribonucleoside d(7-Ni) was previously shown to furnish a highly efficient approach to photochemically trigger DNA backbone cleavage at preselected position when inserted in a DNA fragment. In the present report, we examine its potential use as universal DNA nucleoside, by analogy with the 5-nitroindole analog that is generally considered as universal base. The d(7-Ni) phosphoramidite was incorporated into oligonucleotides. Hybridization properties of resulting 11mer duplexes indicated a behavior close to that of the 5-nitroindole analog. Enzymatic recognition by Klenow fragment exonuclease-free using 40mers containing the unnatural bases as templates indicated notably a decrease of the polymerase activity with preferential incorporation of dAMP opposite both the 7-Ni and 5-Ni bases. Incorporation of the d(7-Ni) triphosphate was also studied indicating absence of significant differences between the incorporation kinetics opposite each natural base in the template. All the hybridization and enzymatic data indicate that 7-nitroindole can be considered as a cleavable base analog, although not strictly fulfilling, like the 5-nitro isomer, all properties required for a universal base.",

          "text": "Design of modified nucleosides or triphosphates able to substitute for natural nucleic acids components and possessing photochemically cleavable properties is of high interest in the development of new nucleic acids fragmentation tools. DNA fragmentation is frequently required for nucleic acids analysis (sequencing, structural analysis) and a number of cleavage techniques exist, each presenting limitations. Restriction enzymes have been used quite frequently in many applications, however their size and sequence do not allow systematic use. Artificial compounds able to cleave DNA have been developed. These chemical nucleases including notably metallic complexes or photoactive derivatives necessitate addition of reagents and consequently removal of byproducts. Direct DNA fragmentation via photochemical processes is an attractive approach allowing both spatial and temporal control and offering the advantage of being fully reagent-free, permitting DNA fragmentation in cell or during PCR reactions. However, only a limited number of photocleavable DNA 'building blocs' have been developed. Most consist of nucleoside analogs chemically inserted in DNA fragments and are based on the photochemical properties of the o-nitrobenzyl group.",

          "text": "We reported the synthesis, structure and photochemical properties of the 7-nitroindole nucleoside d(7-Ni). Illumination of oligonucleotides containing d(7-Ni) triggers a radical process in which the excited nitro group induces an intramolecular H-1' abstraction leading quantitatively to the highly labile deoxyribonolactone moiety accompanied with loss of the 7-nitrosoindole fragment. Subsequent mild basic or thermal treatment leads to cleavage of the DNA strand (Figure 1). The reaction is total, rapid and sequence independent. This photoactive 7-nitroindole heterocycle is indeed an analog of the 4-, 5- and 6-nitroindoles which have been investigated as 'universal' bases in oligonucleotides, among which the authors concluded that the 5-nitro isomer was superior giving highest duplex stability and behaving indiscriminately towards each of the four natural bases in duplex melting experiments. 'Universal base analogs' have indeed attracted much attention in recent years due to their intrinsic fundamental interest and to their potential applications as biochemical tools (use as primers for PCR and sequencing or as substrates for enzymes as triphosphates). Apart from the afore-mentioned 5-nitroindole considered as being among the best base analogs such compounds as nitropyrroles, 8-aza-7-deazapurine-2,6-diamine or hydrophobic structures containing notably the isocarbostyryl ring have been developed. It was thus of interest to investigate the photocleavable 7-nitroindole as a potential 'universal' base and compare it to its 5-nitroindole isomer (Figure 2). This compound could thus possess the two complementary properties of being universal and photocleavable, an approach that has been elegantly pioneered by Pirrung in developing the DNA base analog nitropiperonyl 2'-deoxyriboside. In the present paper, we report on the base-pairing properties of d(7-Ni) in oligonucleotide duplexes and compare it to the 5-nitroindole isomer. We also describe enzymatic experiments to study the recognition of this unnatural nucleoside incorporated in oligonucleotides by the DNA polymerase Klenow fragment exonuclease-free as well as the synthesis and incorporation of the d(7-Ni) triphosphate by the polymerase.",

The nitroindole nucleoside phosphoramidite [d(7-Ni)] was prepared as previously reported. The 40 nt long oligonucleotides were used as template in enzymatic reactions. Melting experiments and CD were conducted on shorter oligonucleotides (11mer). During the automated synthesis, the standard cycles for 1 mumol DNA synthesis were modified since double amounts of phosphoramidites were used for coupling and after this step also double amount of capping reagent was added. For incorporation of the nitroindole nucleosides [d(7-Ni) or d(5-Ni)], standard coupling time was prolonged by 10 min and quantity of capping reagent multiplied by 5. After automated synthesis, the oligomers for CD and melting experiments keeping the DMT group in 5' terminal were cleaved from the support by concentrated aqueous ammonia for 1 h, deprotected by heating at 55 C for 24 h. Finally, oligomers were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reversed-phase nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel 10 x 250 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5-35% in 20 min) in 20 mM ammonium acetate solution (pH 7). Oligomers for enzymatic reaction were detritylated on column, cleaved from support then deprotected as described previously. These oligomers were purified by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7 M urea. The concentration of oligodeoxynucleotides was determined by UV. Oligonucleotide sequences used for experiments have been reported in Table 1.",

          "text": "In order to interpret the previous results, we investigated the possible influence of the nature of the downstream template base (N20) on the extension of the primer terminated by the 7-Ni unnatural base. Experiments were conducted on the same 18mer primer (sequence 12) hybridized successively to 40mer templates (sequences 13, 20-22) varying only by the nature of base N20 (Figure 9). The primers elongated by one 7-Ni base were prepared as described in the previous experiment (Figure 9, lanes 2, 6, 10 and 14). It should be noted that the 18mer primer annealed to template in which N20 was a guanine was only partially converted in the conditions used. In a second step, elongation was continued either in the presence of the triphosphate complementary to base N20 located 5' to thymine in the template (Figure 9, dATP: lane 3, dTTP: lane 7, dGTP: lane 11, dCTP: lane 12) or in the presence of the four dNTPs (Figure 9, lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16). For each duplex, primers terminated by 7-Ni were extended in the presence of a unique triphosphate. When dATP was added (duplex in which N20 is thymine) the 7-Ni primer was elongated by one or two units (Figure 9, lane 3). In the presence of dTTP or dCTP, the 7-Ni primer was extended by 1 nt (Figure 9, lanes 7 and 15). However, primer extension in the presence of dCTP only led to small amounts of reaction product. Incorporation of three guanines was observed for the duplex in which the template base N was a cytosine. Full-length extension (40mer) was observed in the presence of the mixture of the four dNTPs for all duplexes.",

          "text": "We have studied the impact on DNA duplex stability of the presence of the d(7-Ni) unnatural base opposite each native base. For comparison, we also measured the stability of duplexes containing the 5-Ni analog that is generally considered as a universal base. Thermal denaturation experiments showed that the two unnatural bases lead to strong decrease in duplex stability comparable to that caused by the presence of a mismatch. Destabilization is slightly more important for the duplex containing the 7-Ni base as compared to the 5-Ni isomer. Another criterion required for a universal base concerns absence of discrimination when the unnatural base in one strand faces any of the four natural bases in the complementary strand. The two nitroindole bases have comparable behavior, exhibiting slight discrimination, the 7-Ni base being slightly more discriminating. From a structural point of view, the CD spectra of the various duplexes containing the 7-Ni base showed the typical shape of B-DNA, indicating the absence of major distortions induced by the unnatural base. It can thus be concluded that as far as hybridization properties are concerned, the 7-Ni base exhibits behavior comparable to that of the 5-isomer although it cannot be considered as a true universal base according to this criterion.",

          "text": "Replication was next examined involving the unnatural nucleobase 7-Ni both in template DNA and as triphosphate. For comparison, recognition by KF exo- of d(5-Ni) present in the template was also studied. In the sequence context examined, we observed that dAMP was preferentially inserted opposite both 7-Ni and 5-Ni, with rates varying by a factor close to 10. The frequency for incorporation opposite both unnatural bases followed the order: dAMP >> dGMP = dTMP > dCMP. However, dAMP, dGMP and dTMP were more efficiently incorporated when facing d(7-Ni) than d(5-Ni). dCMP was almost not inserted by the enzyme opposite each of the unnatural bases. These results suggest that d(7-Ni) is recognized by KF exo- more efficiently than d(5-Ni). We also investigated the effect of the sequence on nucleoside incorporation opposite d(7-Ni). We observed that the nature of the downstream template base was without effect on the selectivity of the reaction: insertion of dAMP opposite the unnatural base was favored over dGMP, dTMP and dCMP. The effect of 7-Ni on KF exo- seems similar to that exhibited by a large spectrum of DNA lesions, such as the abasic site for which the 'A-rule' has been defined, or the 2'-deoxyribonolactone damage. Consequently, 7-Ni, as well as 5-Ni cannot be considered as a true universal base when present in the template, since the four natural triphosphates are not incorporated equally well in front of these unnatural bases. Primer extension experiments investigated in the presence of the four natural triphosphates showed that d(7-Ni) like d(5-Ni) when present in the template led to a decrease of the polymerase activity. Indeed, after addition of 1 nt, primer extension was very slow although full-length primers were obtained.",

Quite remarkably, the kinetic parameters determined do not reveal significant differences for insertion in front of the four natural bases, behaving in this aspect as a universal nucleotide. The triphosphate was inserted opposite each natural base with at least the same efficiency as dAMP opposite thymine. In addition, the d(7-Ni) triphosphate was also inserted efficiently opposite itself in the template. Indeed, Romesberg reported that several hydrophobic aromatic nucleosides were preferentially incorporated opposite themselves, or similar structures rather than opposite natural nucleosides.",

          "text": "We also studied the extension of primers terminated by the unnatural base 7-Ni. We found that 7-Ni behaves as chain terminator when facing adenine, guanine or cytosine in the template. On the other hand, when facing thymine the 7-Ni primer was elongated by two adenines in the presence of dAMP and full-length elongation occurred in the presence of the four triphosphates. This elongation was not dependent on the nature of the base downstream to thymine in the template. The fact that extension of the primer terminated by 7-Ni is possible when opposed to thymine suggests recognition of 7-Ni by KF exo- as an adenine. It thus appears that the d(7-Ni) triphosphate behaves differently from the d(5-Ni) triphosphate. Indeed, Brown reported that once incorporated opposite natural bases, 5-nitroindole (like 3-nitropyrrole, also considered as universal base) caused chain termination.",

It was first designed as a precursor to prepare DNA fragments containing the highly labile deoxyribonolactone lesion. Further work showed that it furnishes a highly efficient approach to generate DNA backbone cleavage at preselected position in the sequence. The present work shows that 7-Ni presents some of the biophysical and enzymatic recognition properties required for a universal base analog as it shares many common features with its 5-nitroindole isomer. It can thus be considered as a cleavable base analog, although not fulfilling strictly all requirements for a 'universal' base analog. Indeed as pointed out in a recent review, none of the analogs reported so far does fulfill all criteria and it may be that a single analog cannot.",
