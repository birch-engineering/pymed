Post-translational modification of one or more of the cysteine residues accounts for 5 kDa of the weight difference as measured on a cys-less pR mutant. At pH 9.5 and in the presence of octylglucoside and diheptanoylphosphotidylcholine, flash photolysis results in fast H+ release and a 400-nm absorbing (M-like) photoproduct.

Each intermediate has a distinct absorbance maximum; the most studied are bR (570 nm), M (412 nm), and O (640 nm) since these are the ones that can be produced in the highest concentration at physiological pH values. Monitoring of the absorbance at individual wavelengths after photoexcitation is used to determine the relative concentrations and decay times of each of these photointermediates. The L   M transition in bR is characterized by the deprotonation of the Schiff base to Asp-85, producing the distinctive 412 nm absorbance maximum of M, and by so-called fast proton release, the ejection of a proton from a different (unknown) residue into the external medium on the ~10-100 mus time scale, depending on pH. Reprotonation of the Schiff base from Asp-96 occurs during the M   N transition with an absorbance maximum of 560 nm. The N   O transition involves the reprotonation of the Asp-96 from the cytoplasmic space.",

This assumption is actually expected to underestimate the purity of pR produced, by up to ~20%, since the pR we expressed has 10 tryptophan and 14 tyrosine residues, as compared to 8 tryptophans and 11 tyrosines in bR from H. salinarum. The absorbance of contaminant proteins was assumed to be 1.1 for a 1 mg/mL solution. By using these assumptions, the relative concentrations of pR and other proteins can be determined from the absorbance spectra of the various fractions (fig. 1). The resulting purity values correlate well with those Coomasie-stained SDS-PAGE gels (see below). The OG extract of cholate-washed membrane pellets starts out at a pR content of 7% total protein (w/w). The Phenylsepharose column increases the purity level to 24%, with approximately 5% loss. The final purification step by hydroxylapatite column chromatography produces pR with ~85% purity and a further loss of ~60%, i.e. the overall yield of the two column procedure was ~30%.",

However, we observed a significantly higher apparent molecular weight (~36,000) for wild type pR on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, lanes D and E). Post-translational modification of pR must almost certainly account for some of the observed molecular weight difference between pR and bR. Lipids or sugars covalently bound to the protein surface would not be removed during the purification procedure and could cause a higher apparent molecular weight. Cysteines are frequently a site of lipid association with membrane proteins, (e.g. mammalian rhodopsin, which has two palmitoyl molecules attached to cysteine residues). Therefore we compared the SDS-PAGE gel mobility of wild-type pR to that of a cys-less mutant (pR-TCM). The elimination of the three possible sulfhydryl attachment sites lowers the apparent molecular weight of the pR-TCM by 5,000 (Fig. 2, lane C). From this, we conclude that at least one of the three cysteines in pR is probably modified post-translationally.",

Braiman, unpublished data) indicative of a chromophore structure very close to native light-adapted (i.e. all-trans) bR in purple membrane. However, there is one major difference: pR in OG exhibits an upshifted, doublet C=N Schiff base band consisting of two components of nearly-equal intensity. These appear to correspond to the presence of two distinct subpopulations of pR, at least when expressed in E. coli and solubilized in OG micelles.

In the case of the lambda-proteobacteria, which in the open ocean (pH 7.8-8.0) occupy a signficantly more alkaline environment than halobacteria, perhaps the proton-release group is simply not under any evolutionary pressure to be capable of deprotonating in the M state at neutral pH.

The latter seems unlikely due to the DHPC molecule being zwitterionic at pH 9.5, with no proton on the trimethyl-modified nitrogen of the choline.

          "text": "A comparison of the primary sequences of pR and bR at first glance seems as to preclude fast H+ release as part of the proton-pumping mechanism of pR due to the absence of residues analogous to Glu194 and Glu 204 of bR. However, fast H+ release is indeed observed in pR under conditions where an M intermediate is formed. Glu194 and Glu 204 in bR play a role in fast H+ release that is apparently not required for the mechanism of the bR family of proton transporters. It is therefore necessary to conclude that either the H+-release groups in pR and bR are non-homologous surface carboxylic acid residues (as suggested previously), or else that a conserved non-carboxylic acid residue, i.e. Arg82/94 or Asp85/97, is the H+-release group in pR. The higher pH requirement for the M intermediate of pR presumably corresponds with adaptation to the more alkaline oceanic environment in which the gamma-proteobacteria are found.",

Beja). Single colonies were selected and grown overnight in LB/amp media (200 ml, 37 C, 300 rpm). This culture was then diluted 10x into several 500-ml cultures. After a further 2 h incubation in the shaker bath, a stock solution of 20% L-arabinose was added, to give a final concentration of 0.2% L-arabinose. This culture was then incubated for 4 h (37 C, 300 rpm). The cells (~20 ml wet volume) were then collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm x 30 min) and washed 3x with 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.1 (buffer A). The cells were then resuspended in buffer A and incubated at 4 C with 50 mug all-trans-retinal (added as a concentrated ethanol solution) for 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm x 30 min), then resuspended in 60 mL buffer A containing 0.3 mg/mL lysozyme, and stirred for 4 h at room temperature. The cells were again collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm x 30 min), then lysed with 20 ml of 20% sodium cholate, pH 7.1 (30 min., 4 C). The cells were centrifuged again (6000 rpm x 30 min), and the supernatants collected. After extracting 3x more with the same cholate solution, the pooled supernatants were diluted 10x with buffer A and centrifuged at 180,000 g for 45 min to collect the membrane pellet. This cholate-washed membrane pellet was then further extracted 3x with 3.0% beta-octyl-D-glucoside (OG) in buffer A (30 min, with stirring, 4 C). The pooled supernatants, containing OG-solubilized pR (~15 mg), were then diluted 6x with buffer A.",
