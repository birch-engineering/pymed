Available epidemiological data support a linear dose-response relationship down to doses as low as about 100 mSv. However, the magnitude of risk per unit dose depends strongly on when radiation exposure occurs: exposure before the age of 20 years carries the greatest risk. Other characteristics that may influence the magnitude of dose-specific risk include attained age (that is, age at observation for risk), age at first full-term birth, parity, and possibly a history of benign breast disease, exposure to radiation while pregnant, and genetic factors.",

Owing to high levels of screening in developed countries and the relatively favorable prognosis of early-stage disease, it is also the most prevalent malignancy in women, with almost 4 million women alive who have had breast cancer in the past 5 years. In the USA, it is estimated that about 216,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and that 40,000 will die from the disease.

Thereafter, incidence still increases with age, but more slowly. The strong dependence on age, as seen for many other adult-type cancers, is probably related to accumulating genetic damage that occurs during a human lifespan. The apparent change in slope of the age-incidence curve at about age 50 years is unique for breast cancer, and this is presumably related to hormonal changes associated with menopause, which is accompanied by a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogens and other hormones are thought to affect the progression of initiated mammary gland cells in the path to malignancy. This has been shown clearly in early rodent studies, where chemical-associated or radiation-associated mammary tumors were most abundant after additional hormonal stimulation. Post-menopausal women might therefore experience less tumor progression than premenopausal women. This concept of hormonal carcinogenesis is also consistent with epidemiological observations that late menarche and early menopause have a protective effect against breast cancer. Women who have a late menarche and/or early menopause have a smaller number of menstrual cycles and therefore shorter exposure to ovarian hormones during the reproductive years than women who have early menarche and/or late menopause.",

Before pregnancy, mammary gland cells are in a vulnerable undifferentiated state but differentiate to functioning milk-producing structures during pregnancy. It is thought that pregnancies, and FFTP in particular, consecutively decrease the pool of vulnerable breast cells. Interestingly, young women are at increased risk for breast cancer in the 5 years post-partum, possibly related to the promoting effects of the hormonal milieu of pregnancy. The short-term increased risk for breast cancer was highest for women delivering a first child at older ages, who might have accumulated more premalignant conditions than younger women. This dual-effect phenomenon, namely the short-term increasing, but long-term reducing, effects of pregnancy on breast cancer risk, has been shown not only for a first pregnancy but also for subsequent pregnancies. In addition, the breast cancer risk for women with FFTP in the age range 30-34 years approaches that of nulliparous women, whereas those delivering their firstborn after age 35 years are at higher risk than nulliparous women.",

An international pooled analysis showed that breast cancer risk was increased, by 20%, for women who used oral contraceptives up to breast cancer diagnosis, but not for women who stopped using oral contraceptives more than 10 years before cancer diagnosis. Other risk factors for breast cancer include a history of certain types of benign breast disease (BBD), mammographically dense tissue, high body mass index among post-menopausal women, height, and alcohol use. Also implicated are exposures in utero and during childhood to estrogens and other hormones, as well as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and other indicators of energy balance and growth.

Breast cancer risk increases with the number of affected first-degree relatives. Risk also seems to be greater for women with a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age (usually defined as less than 50 years). Highly penetrant mutations in the heritable breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for some of the relationship between family history and breast cancer risk, whereas other inherited genetic traits, habits, and shared environment are also likely contributors. Using a database of almost 45,000 twins, Lichtenstein and colleagues estimated that 27% of all breast cancer can be explained by genetic factors or their interaction with environmental factors, although inherited susceptibility mutations in BCRA1 and BRCA2 seem to account for less than 10% of all breast cancer cases (irrespective of family history). BRCA1 mutations have been suggested to account for about 45% of breast cancer cases with a family history of breast cancer. BRCA1 mutations, which seem to be more prevalent than BRCA2 mutations, probably account for a greater share of breast cancer cases. Although the roles of these genes remain to be elucidated, loss of function in both alleles seems to be necessary for the characteristic increased risk of early-onset breast cancer.",

The average estimated radiation dose to the breast tissue varied considerably across these populations, ranging from 0.02 Sv to more than 20 Sv. (The gray [Gy] is the unit of absorbed radiation dose. The sievert [Sv] is a weighted sum of doses [dose equivalent] used for different types of radiation such as the mixed gamma and neutron radiation from the atomic bombings. In terms of biological effectiveness, 1 Sv of mixed radiation is assumed to be equivalent to 1 Gy of gamma rays or X-rays. For most X-rays or gamma rays that are used for medical purposes, dose in Gy and dose equivalent in Sv are numerically the same, and in the present report the dose in Gy will be treated interchangeably with the dose equivalent in Sv.) In contrast to most other studies, the overall risk of breast cancer was not clearly elevated in the tinea capitis cohort, which had the lowest average breast dose. It has been noted that increased breast cancer risk in a few subgroups of that cohort seemed to be related to unusually low risk in the control group.

In a pooled analysis of eight studies among female populations exposed to diagnostic or therapeutic radiation for benign conditions, or exposed to the atomic bombs in Japan, there was suggestive evidence of this cell-killing effect in the form of a flattening of the linear dose-response relationship at the highest doses. However, a recent large study among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) did not show clear evidence of such flattening, although these patients generally are exposed to very high chest doses.

The risk also can be expressed in terms of excess absolute risk (EAR), expressed in incident cases per 104 woman-year-Sv, or the annual number of breast cancers attributable to a radiation exposure of 1 Sv among 10,000 radiation-exposed women. In a pooled analysis of data from different exposed populations, estimated EAR was consistent between Japanese atomic bomb survivors and US populations exposed to diagnostic radiation during lung collapse therapy for tuberculosis, or to X-ray therapy for enlarged thymus (pooled estimate 9.9, 95% confidence interval 7.1-14). However, EAR was substantially higher for Swedish (32, 21-47) and US (15, 7.7-24) women given radiation therapy for BBD and substantially lower for two populations of Swedish women treated as infants with X-rays and radium plaques for hemangioma (pooled estimate 5.1, 1.3-11, for exposure at 6 months of age).

The implications of these findings for modification of dose-specific breast cancer risk by fractionation and protraction of dose are unclear, and the results could reflect effects of yet unrecognized confounding factors. There therefore seems to be no simple way to describe the association between radiation dose and breast cancer incidence, which varies considerably for different populations.

Biologically, age is a surrogate of various stages in breast tissue development as well as a marker of cumulative endogenous hormone exposures, both of which vary considerably across a woman's lifespan. In terms of tissue development, the normal breast is different from many other organs in that it is not fully differentiated in newborns, despite rapid proliferation and development in utero. After a relatively quiet quiescent period in childhood, rapid proliferation and growth again take place during puberty followed by terminal endbud differentiation during a FFTP when the breast is prepared for lactation. Periods of enhanced cell proliferation, namely in utero, puberty and pregnancy, have been proposed to represent windows of increased susceptibility for mammary carcinogenesis. Proliferation is associated with increased levels of DNA synthesis, which in turn provides opportunities for DNA damage by mammary carcinogens and an increased probability of reproduction of unrepaired or misrepaired DNA damage to the progeny of the damaged cell.",

Second, HL is rare in young children; the annual incidence in 5-9-year-olds is only 10% of that in 15-19-year-olds. Only a few childhood cancer survivor cohort studies reported on second cancers among subjects younger than 10 years at diagnosis. Among patients treated at the youngest ages, breast cancer cases occurred in the Late Effects Study Group and Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohorts. Most recent analyses from these cohorts used appropriate statistical methods to take into account the underlying increasing risk with increasing age and showed no statistically significant difference in breast cancer risk between those diagnosed with HL in childhood or during puberty or early adolescence.

However, because the youngest at exposure were followed up until a much younger adult age, it is possible that they developed more breast tumors after the study cut-off date. Because studies of cancers induced by chemical agents showed that young virgin rats were more susceptible than older rats, the authors proposed that the carcinogenic impact of chemicals and radiation in rats might involve different types of mammary stem cell.

In other words, the life of each subject in a radiation-exposed cohort can be represented by a timeline expressed in attained age, with tick marks at the age of cancer diagnosis, age at death, or age at the end of the follow-up for the study (for example 31 December 2003). This information can then be used to calculate the risk of radiation-associated cancer at a certain age or to adjust for attained age in the cohort. Recently published analyses of radiation-related risk of all solid cancers as a group show convincingly that the ERR declines with increasing attained age. However, the effect of attained age on radiation-related breast cancer risk is difficult to separate from that of age at exposure, even in a population such as the atomic bomb survivors for which exposure was to a general population of all ages and follow-up has been of long duration. For example, the correlation between age at exposure and age at diagnosis was 0.7 for breast cancers diagnosed in the LSS population between 1950 and 1990. Interestingly, in the LSS, it turned out that the only significant effect of attained age was explained by a high risk of early-onset (before age 35 years) breast cancer in a subgroup of women, whereas the relative risk remained fairly constant for women older than 35 years at follow-up (see also the subsection 'Genetic factors' below). This effect was independent of the strong modification of the dose response by exposure age. In a pooled analysis the EAR increased with advancing attained age, which is consistent with the strong increase in background risk of breast cancer with increasing age.",

The most comprehensive analysis so far is based on a nested case-control study of 196 breast cancer patients and 566 matched controls among Japanese atomic bomb survivors. As expected, early first birth, multiple births and long cumulative lactation history had a protective effect not only against baseline breast cancer but also against radiation-associated breast cancer in this population, in the sense that the dose-specific excess rate was reduced at least as much as the baseline rate. The protective effect of early age at first birth held for women who were parous at the time of exposure and for women who completed a first pregnancy after radiation exposure, suggesting that an early first pregnancy may protect against the carcinogenic effects of radiation exposure on the breast regardless of whether the exposure occurred before or after the pregnancy.

Genes affecting DNA repair processes have been implicated in particular because DNA is a direct target for ionizing radiation in the cell. Various types of damage caused by ionizing radiation include, for example, damage to single bases, single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks (DSBs) and multiply-damaged sites. Single-base and single-strand damage are not specific to radiation and can be repaired rapidly and with high fidelity, by using the non-affected strand as template to fill the gaps with complementary bases. In contrast, DSBs are caused by few other carcinogens. It has been hypothesized that the linear dose-response relationship for relatively low radiation doses, as found for breast cancer, reflects the linear association between radiation dose and DSBs. If left unrepaired, DSBs will in most cases lead to cell death through either apoptosis or mitotic cell death due to loss of genetic material. Alternatively, effective DNA repair will solve the problem. Recent cell culture studies found that DNA repair mechanisms are not activated in the presence of DSBs induced at very low radiation doses (about 1 mSv). This may be a protective mechanism, avoiding possible misrepair. However, if repaired incorrectly, DSBs can lead to carcinogenesis through translocations, inversions, or deletions of genetic material.",

The resulting chromosomes are probably a major contributor to the first step in the carcinogenic path of ionizing radiation. Each repair process involves damage recognition, a pause in the cell cycle to permit repair before the cell divides, and actual repair. The efficacy of DNA damage repair may be influenced by genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cycle control, as well as genes encoding proteins explicitly involved in repair activities. As the full complexity of the processes involved in DSBs is unfolding it is becoming clear that these are not entirely distinct processes because some proteins, for example those encoded by the genes ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), BRCA1, and BRCA2, might have a role in both homologous recombination and NHEJ.",

Because many different types of ATM mutations have been identified so far, and more probably remain to be discovered, it has been suggested that ATM mutations involved with increased risk of breast cancer among ATM heterozygotes might be of a different type from the ATM mutations found in most (although not all) AT patients. Recently, Dutch investigators used a highly selective group of breast cancer patients with early-onset disease (less than 45 years of age) and a high prevalence of bilateral disease, which are both characteristics of possible genetic susceptibility and found a high prevalence (9%) of ATM mutations, including several different types. A much larger series that included 511 patients with bilateral disease in the USA did not confirm these results.",

Like AT, Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a rare recessive genetic disorder characterized by increased radiosensitivity and predisposition for lymphohematopoietic malignancies at young age.

Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer of the retina that arises in young children and can be either sporadic or hereditary. Patients with the hereditary form of the disease are born with one mutated retinoblastoma (RB) gene.

Although low-penetrance DNA repair genes represent an area of active research, currently available studies typically report main effects of the DNA repair gene polymorphisms. It is challenging to study the combined role of genes and radiation in the etiology of breast cancer in humans because one needs a large population exposed to a range of radiation doses to ensure statistical power to detect such a gene-radiation interaction, accurate estimates of radiation dose to the breast, availability of blood samples or other biospecimen types to perform genotyping on extracted DNA, and an appropriate comparison group. Also, the genetic mutation or polymorphism of interest is typically very rare, further complicating matters. Thus, so far, few studies have fulfilled all of these criteria. Efforts are underway, for example, to assess the roles of polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and low-dose chronic radiation exposure among women enrolled in the US Radiologic Technologist Cohort and the roles of both polymorphic variation in ATM and radiotherapy for the risk of contralateral breast cancer among breast cancer survivors in the Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) study.",

Age at exposure is a consistent modifier of the radiation-related breast cancer risk, with the highest risk seen for girls exposed before age 20 years and zero to minimal risk detected for women exposed after the menopausal ages. Sparse data suggest a high radiation risk among women exposed while pregnant. A small number of studies showed evidence that other etiologic factors for breast cancer, namely age at first birth (before or after radiation exposure), parity, and a history of benign breast disease, influence the risk of a radiation-related breast cancer as well. Although the role of genetic factors in radiation-related breast cancer is of great interest, it is very challenging to study; except for a likely role of the ATM gene, so far few other genetic risk factors have been established.",
