          "text": "Light inhibits mating and haploid fruiting of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, but the mechanisms involved were unknown. Two genes controlling light responses were discovered through candidate gene and insertional mutagenesis approaches. Deletion of candidate genes encoding a predicted opsin or phytochrome had no effect on mating, while strains mutated in the white collar 1 homolog gene BWC1 mated equally well in the light or the dark. The predicted Bwc1 protein shares identity with Neurospora crassa WC-1, but lacks the zinc finger DNA binding domain. BWC1 regulates cell fusion and repression of hyphal development after fusion in response to blue light. In addition, bwc1 mutant strains are hypersensitive to ultraviolet light. To identify other components required for responses to light, a novel self-fertile haploid strain was created and subjected to Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis. One UV-sensitive mutant that filaments equally well in the light and the dark was identified and found to have an insertion in the BWC2 gene, whose product is structurally similar to N. crassa WC-2. The C. neoformans Bwc1 and Bwc2 proteins interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Deletion of BWC1 or BWC2 reduces the virulence of C. neoformans in a murine model of infection; the Bwc1-Bwc2 system thus represents a novel protein complex that influences both development and virulence in a pathogenic fungus. These results demonstrate that a role for blue/UV light in controlling development is an ancient process that predates the divergence of the fungi into the ascomycete and basidiomycete phyla.",

          "text": "Light is the fundamental energy source for life on earth and as such is a major environmental signal for organisms from all kingdoms of life. In the fungal kingdom, light can regulate growth, the direction of growth, asexual and sexual reproduction, and pigment formation, all of which are important aspects for the survival and dissemination of fungal species. These processes have negative implications to many aspects of human life, as the uncontrolled proliferation of fungi can lead to devastating plant disease, mold, and human disease. On the other hand, fungi are essential for recycling nutrients in the environment, in mycorrhizal interactions with plants, and as a source of food and pharmaceutical metabolites for humans. Understanding the role of environmental signals in fungal development is vital to increase the benefits and decrease the costs that fungi present. Despite the importance of light to fungal development, much has yet to be determined to illuminate the mechanisms fungi use to perceive and respond to light.",

While spectral analyses and the morphological effects of light have been well characterized in genera such as Coprinus (a basidiomycete) or Phycomyces (a zygomycete), at the molecular level Neurospora crassa (an ascomycete) is best understood based on the functions of the white collar (wc-1 and wc-2) genes in light sensing. In N. crassa, blue light regulates induction of carotenoid pigment production, protoperithecia (sexual fruiting body) formation and phototropism of perithecial beaks, and circadian rhythm, all of which are abolished by mutations in wc-1 or wc-2. These two genes encode proteins with several conserved domains, including a zinc finger DNA binding domain found in both proteins. The two proteins physically interact through PAS (conserved in Per, Arnt, Sim proteins) domains. The WC-1 protein functions as the blue light receptor through a specialized PAS domain responsible for sensing light, oxygen, and voltage in other proteins (LOV domain), and, together with WC-2, acts as a transcription factor. The WC-1 protein interacts with a flavin chromophore [flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] to function as the blue light receptor. A small protein, VIVID, also perceives blue light through a LOV domain and modulates N. crassa sensitivity to light. N. crassa has an additional four candidate photoactive protein homologs whose functions in photoperception remain elusive.",

          "text": "We set out to identify genes involved in the process by which light inhibits mating of the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. In nature, cryptococcal varieties are associated with bird excreta, soil, tree hollows, and even caves. Thus, the light stimuli studied under laboratory conditions are highly relevant to the varying light signals the fungus experiences in the wild. C. neoformans exists as a haploid yeast with two bipolar mating types (a and alpha). MATa and MATalpha cells fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha that terminates in a basidium in which nuclear fusion and meiosis occur, producing four long chains of haploid basidiospores by mitosis and budding. A similar process, known as haploid or monokaryotic fruiting, can occur with only one mating partner that also gives rise to filaments that terminate in basidium-like structures and produce short spore chains. Spores have been implicated as an infectious propagule, further underscoring the importance of understanding the regulatory processes governing basidiospore production. Mating and fruiting are controlled in the laboratory by stimuli such as the presence of potential mating partners (via pheromone signaling), nutrient limitation, desiccation, temperature, and light. Many aspects of the transduction pathways for these signals have been elucidated, particularly in response to pheromones and nutrient limitation, but no components of light signaling had been reported to date for this important human pathogen. We identify here two genes required for C. neoformans responses to light, and demonstrate their role in blue light regulation of development and sensitivity to UV light, and their requirement for full virulence of this pathogen in a mammalian host.",

Our assays used cardboard containers in which 9-cm2 holes were excised from the lid and overlaid with aluminum foil or clear plastic wrap.

Opsins are a class of seven-transmembrane proteins that bind retinal via a conserved lysine residue to form ion pumps or light receptors in animals and Archaea. Opsins have been identified in the genomes of a number of fungi, but as yet have no known function. Phytochromes are histidine or serine/threonine kinase red/far-red light receptors identified in plants, and more recently in bacteria (reviewed in). Two phytochrome homologs have been noted in the genome of N. crassa, but also have as yet no known function. The predicted wc-1 homolog contains a LOV domain, two additional PAS domains, and a nuclear localization signal. In contrast to the N. crassa wc-1 gene, the C. neoformans homolog has no DNA binding domain; our designation of the gene as Basidiomycete White Collar 1 (BWC1) is meant to reflect this unique structure.",

The abilities to mate and to haploid-fruit in the light and dark were examined by monitoring the production of filaments. There was no effect on mating or fruiting in strains with the opsin ops1 or phytochrome phy1 mutations, either alone or in combination (unpublished data). In contrast, bwc1 mutants were insensitive to light. All crosses in which both mating partners (bilateral crosses) carried the bwc1 deletion showed equivalent mating in the light and the dark, as assessed by the production of filaments after 24 h and 48 h, while in strains with a wild-type copy of BWC1, light reduced mating (Figure 1A). In unilateral crosses, i.e., in which a bwc1 mutant strain was crossed to wild type, only a very modest increase in filamentation in the light was observed relative to crosses between two wild-type parents. The bwc1 mutant strains exhibited more haploid fruiting in the presence of light compared to BWC1 wild-type strains, and a somewhat higher level of fruiting in the dark (Figure 1B). Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of BWC1 into a bwc1 mutant strain restored the inhibition of mating and fruiting by light (Figure 1).

The ops1 and phy1 mutant strains were as sensitive to UV light as wild type, but the bwc1 mutants were markedly hypersensitive to UV light (Figure 3). Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of the BWC1 gene into the bwc1 mutant strain restored a wild-type level of sensitivity to UV light. Based on studies in other organisms, one target gene could be that encoding photolyase. However, there is no evidence for a photolyase in C. neoformans, based on the lack of photoreactivation and the absence of a homolog in genome databases (unpublished data).

C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D), utilized in the experiments described thus far, is commonly studied because of the ready availability of established congenic mating partners. However, this variety is uncommon in clinical settings (representing only 5% of cases), and we therefore re-isolated the bwc1, ops1, and phy1 mutations in the most common pathogenic type, C. neoformans var. grubii (serotype A), in which congenic strains have only recently been developed. Mating of serotype A laboratory strains is less efficient than that of the congenic serotype D strains, and their growth in the light is limited on the V8 (pH 5) medium used for genetic crosses. Serotype A bwc1 bilateral crosses mated better in the dark than wild-type strains. Crosses performed in the light rarely resulted in filaments and were observed to do so only in the bwc1 x bwc1 mutant bilateral crosses (unpublished data). Using V8 (pH 7) medium and the serotype D bwc1 strains as mating type tester strains, the effects of light on mating efficiency of serotype A could be more readily established. When crossed to serotype D bwc1 strains, wild-type serotype A strains yielded fewer filaments than the bwc1 mutant strains in both the light and dark, demonstrating a role for suppression of filament formation by BWC1 under both conditions (see Figure 1D). The serotype A bwc1 strains were also found to be hypersensitive to UV light (unpublished data). Reintroduction of the serotype A BWC1 gene complemented the mutant phenotypes of both the serotype A and D bwc1 mutants (Figures 1 and 3). In summary, BWC1 function is conserved in two divergent cryptococcal varieties, and data derived from experiments on laboratory strains are also of significance to clinical isolates.",

Systematic deletion of all of the C. neoformans transcription factors, assuming these were annotated, is not technically feasible at this stage. Similarly, standard insertional mutagenesis poses a problem because the filamentation phenotype requires that both the MATa and MATalpha mating partners bear the same mutation. However, overexpression of a mating type-specific homeodomain protein in a haploid strain of the opposite mating type confers a self-filamentous morphology. We reasoned that such a self-filametous strain could be employed to perform random insertional mutagenesis, and devised a screen to identify the hypothetical protein interacting with Bwc1. The SXI1alpha gene, which encodes the MATalpha-specific homeodomain protein, was introduced into the genome of a MATa haploid strain. The resulting MATa +SXI1alpha strain (AI49) exhibited self-filamentous growth that was regulated by temperature, light, and nutrients. The strain grew as a budding yeast at 37  C and filamented at 25  C, and, like MATa/MATalpha diploids, filamentation was inhibited by light, and was most robust on V8 mating medium (Figure 5A).",

Importantly, the predicted structure of the Bwc2 protein is strikingly similar to that of the N. crassa WC-2 protein, which does not perceive photons directly but instead interacts physically with the light sensor WC-1 and acts as a transcription factor.

In S. cerevisiae strains expressing AD-Bwc1 and BD-Bwc2, or AD-Bwc2 and BD-Bwc1, the ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ reporter genes were all induced and the cells grew in the absence of adenine or histidine and expressed increased levels of beta-galactosidase activity (Figure 6).

These observations indicate that Bwc1 and Bwc2 can interact with one another in vivo.

Attempts to demonstrate Bwc1-Bwc2 interaction in C. neoformans itself via coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged forms of Bwc1 and Bwc2 have been unsuccessful so far, due to the low abundance of the proteins, cross-reactivity of the antibodies with endogenous fungal proteins, and loss-of-function of tagged proteins in strains overexpressing these proteins (unpublished data). These findings demonstrate that Bwc1 and Bwc2 can physically interact when expressed in the nucleus of another fungal species, and that they can do so in a light-independent manner.",

No phenotypes were conferred by the ops1 or phy1 mutations, but deletion of the wc-1 homolog BWC1 abolished the inhibition of mating and haploid fruiting by light. The bwc1 mutant phenotypes in the clinical background were generally equivalent to those observed in serotype D; however, in the serotype A crosses with the bwc1 mutants, it was clear that mating inhibition occurred with a wild-type copy of BWC1 regardless of the light status. In serotype D, inhibition of mating by light was shown to occur at both the cell fusion and the hyphal developmental stages. Cell fusion assays revealed that only one parent requires a bwc1 mutation to circumvent repression by light, and the release from light repression in fusion is equivalent between unilateral (bwc1 x wild type) and bilateral (bwc1 x bwc1) crosses. This observation suggests that during mating only one cell, independent of mating type, needs to commit to fusion. Because a wild-type level of fusion was observed in unilateral crosses, rather than an expected 50% reduction, there must also be cross-talk between the two cells prior to fusion, which is probably mediated via pheromone sensing. Analysis of diploid strains showed that once cell fusion has occurred, the wild-type Bwc1 allele of the protein has sufficient activity, even in the heterozygous state, to repress filament formation in the presence of light to a level equivalent to that observed in wild-type diploid strains.",

The ability of blue or UV light to induce carotenoid formation in N. crassa was first noted a century ago. Subsequent work has focused on light in the blue wavelengths, which is sensible given that any study on UV light and its regulation of fungal development is likely to be complicated by the effects this radiation has on cell viability and media stability. Nevertheless, there is evidence that N. crassa also perceives UV light through WC-1. Prior to cloning the wc-1 gene, the spectra for inhibition of circadian rhythm and for photoinduction of carotenoid production were found to lie in both the UV and blue wavelengths. Light treatment of N. crassa changes the light absorbance properties of mycelia, and the action spectrum of this response is within both the UV and blue wavelengths and closely overlaps that of flavins, with respective peaks at 360 and 470 nm. In particular, the action spectra from physiological data overlap with the properties of the WC-1 protein purified from N. crassa cells, as WC-1-FAD or the chromophore FAD alone show two equal excitation peaks, one at 370 nm (UV) and one at 450 nm (blue). These data suggest that N. crassa WC-1 may also be a UV-responsive protein and function like C. neoformans in protecting the fungus from UV damage. The induction of UV-protecting carotenoids in N. crassa by light in a WC-1-dependent manner supports this hypothesis.

In one strain, the T-DNA insertion lies in the promoter of a gene we designated BWC2, which has an analogous structure to the N. crassa wc-2 gene (a PAS domain and zinc finger DNA binding domain) but shares much less sequence similarity relative to that between C. neoformans BWC1 and N. crassa wc-1. The BWC2 gene was not found in the initial candidate gene search because of this low sequence similarity and because the intron structure of C. neoformans confounded its identity.

The Bwc1-Bwc2 system represents a novel class of protein complex that is required for cellular responses to an environmental stimulus and affects both development (mating) and virulence in pathogenic fungi. In contrast to the cAMP signaling and calcineurin pathways, where mutants have reduced mating efficiency and virulence, here the bwc1 and bwc2 mutants have enhanced mating yet reduced virulence. In bwc1 or bwc2 strains there was no reduction in those traits normally associated with C. neoformans virulence, such as production of melanin or capsule, or growth at 37  C or on minimal media.

In this model, C. neoformans Bwc1-Bwc2 bind to DNA in the dark and act as weak repressors to reduce filament development. We hypothesize that photons perceived through a flavin cofactor cause a conformational change that enhances repression of filament formation and cell fusion, and activates transcription of genes required for UV resistance/DNA repair. It is also formally possible that light causes Bwc1-Bwc2 to increase transcription of a gene that functions to repress mating, and/or represses transcription of a repressor of UV sensitivity. The N. crassa model is similar but differs in several key features. Recent evidence suggests that a complex of two subunits of WC-1 and one subunit of WC-2 form in response to light. The complex positively regulates transcription of genes required for conidiation, mating, and carotenoid production, in marked contrast to the negative regulation of mating observed in C. neoformans. Another difference is that wc-1 is light-regulated in N. crassa, while BWC2 is light-regulated in C. neoformans and BWC1 is not. The N. crassa complex also regulates transcription of frq, and the FRQ protein feedback inhibits the complex, thereby contributing to the wiring of the circadian clock. The roles for WC-1 and WC-2 in N. crassa photoperception also change during the day, adding to the challenge of elucidating their functions. Future studies in C. neoformans will define downstream targets of Bwc1-Bwc2, regulation of Bwc1 and Bwc2 and their complex, and the creation of alleles of Bwc1 bearing mutations in the predicted flavin interacting domain to elucidate the proposed roles of these proteins in light perception.",

          "text": "The Bwc1-Bwc2 interaction of C. neoformans shares conserved features with the WC-1-WC-2 interaction of N. crassa but also exhibits unique functional characteristics. In this model, C. neoformans Bwc1-Bwc2 bind to DNA in the dark and act as weak repressors to reduce filament development. We hypothesize that photons perceived through a proposed flavin moiety on Bwc1 cause a conformational change that increases repression of filament formation and cell fusion, and activates transcription of genes required for UV resistance. Alternatively, UV sensitivity may be mediated through repression by Bwc1-Bwc2 of a repressor protein. The N. crassa model is simplified from: a complex of two units of WC-1 forms in response to light to cause an initial up-regulation of frq transcription above the levels occurring in the dark (FRQ feedback inhibits the White collar complex). The complex also increases transcription of genes required for other processes.",

          "text": "Components of the White collar sensing system have been identified in other fungi (see Figure 5), and are likely to function in light responses in these and other fungal species. Recently the Trichoderma atroviride homologs of N. crassa WC-1 and WC-2 were isolated and mutated, demonstrating a role for these genes in light-induced conidiation and the induction of photolyase. A gene homologous to BWC1 was identified in the model basidiomycete C. cinereus as mutated in a strain defective in light-regulated development of the mushroom cap. Developmental regulation in C. cinereus is blue-light dependent, and UV/blue light also regulate development of numerous other fungi (for review see). A homolog of wc-1 was identified in the truffle-forming ascomycete Tubor bruchii, in which blue light inhibits hyphal growth. Thus, this gene and its homologs may have applications even to cultivated, edible fungi. It will be of interest to establish whether White collar-like proteins are present in the genomes of the two other fungal phyla proposed for genome sequencing, the zygomycetes and the chytrids. The responses of the zygomycete Phycomyces to light, particularly blue and UV wavelengths, have been well characterized, and numerous mutants (e.g., ten different mad mutants) affecting responses or sensitivity to particular wavelengths have been isolated, but no photoreceptor genes have as yet been identified. We predict that some of these known mutations will be found to affect White collar homologs.",

          "text": "Finally, we speculate that White collar genes could be of major significance for terrestrial life. The discovery of the BWC1 and BWC2 genes as potential UV-blue light responsive proteins in a basidiomycete indicates that this type of protein complex is ancient in the fungal kingdom. The fossil record shows a clear divergence of the fungal kingdom into the four phyla by the Devonian [416-359 million years ago (mya)], and a Precambrian origin (prior to 542 mya) for the fungi has been suggested. Margulis et al. proposed that sexual recombination and DNA repair were coselected in the Precambrian for protection against UV light, and genes are known that control both recombination and sensitivity to UV light. Bwc1-Bwc2 in C. neoformans regulates both UV sensitivity and sexual development, ultimately leading to recombination. During the Silurian division (416-444 mya), the UV-protection role of the WC-1 proteins could have conferred a major selective advantage to the fungi when they and plants cocolonized the continents at a time when there was no shade from solar radiation. The proteins could have been especially important at other times of global ecological change associated with elevated UV irradiation due to atmospheric and vegetation changes, such as at the end of the Permian (250 mya) or Cretaceous (65 mya), when there are spikes of fungi in the fossil record. The UV-protecting ability of the WC-1 proteins is a likely selective force that has served to maintain their presence in fungi to this day.",

Gene transcription was tested using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). Three genes were mutated in serotype D strain JEC43 (MATalpha ura5) and serotype A strain JF99 (MATa ura5). Mutations were made by biolistic introduction of disruption alleles generated by overlap PCR with 1.5-kb DNA on either side of the URA5 gene. BWC2 was disrupted using a nourseothricin resistance cassette to replace the gene in the serotype D strain JEC21 or the serotype A strain KN99alpha (both MATalpha). Gene disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis using standard methods. The mutant serotype D strains were crossed to the congenic strain JEC20 (MATa) to obtain strains with the opposite mating type. Through a series of crosses, strains with double or triple mutations in both mating types were isolated. A set of strains with auxotrophic markers (either lys1 or ade2) with the mutation or wild type at the BWC1 locus was also generated by crossing. The serotype A bwc1::URA5 strain was crossed to strain KN99alpha to obtain a MATalpha bwc1 strain. For reconstitution, the BWC1 or BWC2 genes were amplified with primers JOHE8744 and JOHE8745 or JOHE12641 and JOHE12642, respectively, from genomic DNA of strain H99, and ligated adjacent to a cassette conferring resistance to neomycin (G418). A linearized version of this vector was introduced into bwc1 or bwc2 mutant strains. The self-filamentous serotype D strain was obtained by introducing the SXI1alpha gene adjacent to URA5 into strain JEC34 (MATa ura5). This strain was mutated with Agrobacterium-mediated integration of T-DNA containing the NAT gene. Strains created and primers used in strain construction are listed in Tables S1 and S2.",
