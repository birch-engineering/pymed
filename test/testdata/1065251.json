          "text": "The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) is functionally inactivated in the majority of cancers and is a critical mediator of DNA damage checkpoints. Despite the critical importance of RB function in tumor suppression, the coordinate impact of RB loss on the response to environmental and therapeutic sources of damage has remained largely unexplored. Here, we utilized a conditional knockout system to ablate RB in adult fibroblasts. This model system enabled us to investigate the temporal role of RB loss on cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair following ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation (IR) damage. We demonstrate that RB loss compromises rapid cell cycle arrest following UV and IR exposure in adult primary cells. Detailed kinetic analysis of the checkpoint response revealed that disruption of the checkpoint is concomitant with RB target gene deregulation, and is not simply a manifestation of chronic RB loss. RB loss had a differential effect upon repair of the major DNA lesions induced by IR and UV. Whereas RB did not affect resolution of DNA double-strand breaks, RB-deficient cells exhibited accelerated repair of pyrimidine pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PP). In parallel, this repair was coupled with enhanced expression of specific factors and the behavior of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) recruitment to replication and repair foci. Thus, RB loss and target gene deregulation hastens the repair of specific lesions distinct from its ubiquitous role in checkpoint abrogation.",

          "text": "Cells have evolved complex mechanisms of genome surveillance and DNA repair to maintain genetic stability in the face of bombardment by exogenous insult. Cell cycle checkpoint pathways are examples of evolutionarily conserved responses to DNA damage. Following recognition of DNA lesions, such as those induced by ultraviolet radiation (UV) and ionizing radiation (IR), cell cycle checkpoints are elicited to limit the propagation of deleterious mutations to daughter cells. Several checkpoint proteins play essential roles in the maintenance of appropriate DNA damage response. A critical mediator of cell cycle control involved in the DNA damage checkpoint is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB). During early G1 phase of the cell cycle, hypophosphorylated RB is active and binds to members of the E2F transcription factor family to antagonize their function. The RB-E2F complex forms on the promoters of a multitude of E2F target genes to repress transcription. E2F is known to regulate many downstream targets that are involved in cell cycle progression (e.g. cyclin A, cyclin E, cdc2 and cdk2) and DNA replication [e.g. proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), mini-chromosome maintenance-7 (MCM-7), topoisomerase IIalpha, thymidine kinase]. Due to the requisite nature of these target genes, RB-mediated transcriptional repression inhibits progression into S-phase. Control of RB binding to E2Fs is exerted in mid-G1 by the activation of cdk4/cyclin D1 and cdk2/cyclin E, which phosphorylate and inactivate RB thereby allowing S-phase entry. DNA damage has the general influence of activating RB by promoting dephosphorylation. Following DNA damage, the presence of RB is required for cell cycle inhibition. This response has typically been assessed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wherein RB is believed to facilitate arrest by transcriptional repression of key targets. However, prior studies have been limited to analysis of the effect of chronic RB loss, rather than the acute inactivation evident in cancer.",

          "text": "It has been reported that RB function is impaired in the majority of cancers as the activities of several disparate mechanisms result in its functional inactivation. Presumably, RB loss contributes to genetic instability by allowing cells to evade cell cycle regulation and facilitating DNA damage checkpoint bypass. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that RB suppresses the development of aneuploidy following damage. While RB is implicated in gross chromosome instability, its effect on DNA repair remains unexplored. However, a role for RB in repair has recently been suggested by the finding that several RB/E2F regulated genes are involved in the repair of UV and IR damage. Therefore, it can be envisioned that RB loss and downstream target deregulation could have distinct effects upon the cellular response to genotoxic insult, including both checkpoint deregulation and aberrant repair.",

There is a caveat in these models, in that RB loss is compensated by RB related pocket proteins (i.e. p107 and p130) during development. In contrast, RB is acutely lost in the majority of cancer cases. Thus, we utilized an knockout system involving mice harboring a conditional Rb allele in which loxP sites flank Rb exon 19 (RbloxP/loxP mice). Through adenoviral expression of Cre recombinase, acute RB loss can be achieved in genetically stable MAFs. To examine the action of RB in cells, MAFs were initially infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing both GFP and Cre recombinase (Ad-GFP-Cre) or GFP alone (Ad-GFP) as a control. Efficient infection of cells was evident following 16-24 h, as >90% of Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells demonstrated high levels of GFP fluorescence (data not shown). Confirmation of Cre-mediated recombination was performed by RT-PCR analysis using primers in exons 18 and 20 of the Rb gene. RNA was prepared from uninfected MAFs or those infected with Ad-GFP-Cre at 72 h post-infection. RT-PCR analysis revealed loss of Rb RNA and accumulation of the Deltaexon19 transcript in the infected cells relative to the control (Figure 1A). Immunoblotting with anti-RB monoclonal antibody revealed that the Cre-mediated recombination resulted in acute downregulation of RB protein in Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs (Figure 1B).",

In part, this is due to the use of chemotherapeutic agents wherein the induction of DNA damage is delayed due to drug action. Thus, one of the advantages of studying the cellular response to UV or IR is the immediate induction of DNA damage. To understand the kinetics of cell cycle attenuation following exposure to UV and IR, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs were exposed to either 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV or 0, 2.5 or 5 Gy IR and cultured. Following damage, cells were pulsed with BrdU for the final 2 h in culture prior to harvesting at 2, 4 and 6 h. The DNA damage checkpoint was evident as early as 2 h following exposure to either UV or IR as determined by immunofluorescent detection of BrdU incorporation (Figure 2A). Additionally, this response was maintained for at least 6 h following damage. Surprisingly, this rapid response to UV and IR damage was compromised in RB-deficient cells, as Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs largely bypassed cell cycle inhibition at each time point. These data indicate that RB loss is sufficient to bypass the rapid checkpoint response to DNA damage.",

In response to IR or UV damage, ser-18 of p53 (homologous to human ser-15) is known to be rapidly phosphorylated by ATM family kinases. Therefore, as a control for upstream signaling, immunoblotting for total p53 and phospho-p53 ser-18 was performed. To analyze rapid DNA damage signaling, MAFs infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre were treated with 10 J/m2 UV or 2.5 Gy IR and harvested 2 h following treatment and analyzed for total p53 expression by immunoblot (Figure 2B, top panel). Lamin B serves as a control for equal loading. As expected, both cultures exhibited similar inductions of p53 following either UV or IR damage. To further probe the induction kinetics of p53, phospho-p53 expression was analyzed at 0, 1, 3 and 5 h post-treatment (Figure 2B, bottom panel). Not surprisingly, both cultures exhibited relatively equal kinetics of phospho-p53 induction. However, phospho-p53 induction was slightly faster in response to IR than UV and its response to UV persisted longer than that from IR exposure. To subsequently characterize expression levels of downstream RB targets, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs were analyzed at 0, 3 and 5 h following 10 J/m2 UV (Figure 2C, top panel) or 2.5 Gy IR (Figure 2C, bottom panel) exposure. Interestingly, expression levels of PCNA, MCM-7 and cyclin A remained relatively constant during the rapid response to UV and IR indicating that RB action did not affect levels of these downstream targets during checkpoint induction. Equal loading was verified by lamin B immunoblot. These data argue that the rapid function of RB in cell cycle arrest following DNA damage does not apparently involve attenuation of target genes.",

To determine whether loss of RB protein or target gene deregulation is more closely coupled to loss of checkpoint function, we examined the discrete kinetics of this pathway.

Following damage, the cells were pulsed with BrdU for 4 h and harvested for checkpoint analysis (Figure 3B). Scoring of the populations of DNA damaged cells throughout the time course of RB knockout revealed that DNA damage checkpoint function remained intact in response to 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV irradiation through 28 h post-infection. However, by 40 h post-infection the checkpoint response became impaired (Figure 3C, top panel), concurrent with maximal deregulation of target genes following RB protein loss (Figure 3A). Similarly, the equivalent experimental setup was employed to investigate checkpoint function in response to IR damage signaling. Abrogation of proper checkpoint function occurred slightly more rapidly in response to 0, 2.5 or 5 Gy IR, such that cells were able to incorporate BrdU in the presence of DNA damage by 28 h post-infection (Figure 3C, bottom panel). Together, these data reveal that the kinetics of RB loss are concomitant with target gene deregulation and impaired DNA damage checkpoint response.

Here, we employed immunofluorescence with antibodies recognizing gammaH2AX, an efficient measure of double-strand break accumulation, to demonstrate the extent to which these lesions are repaired in the 24 h following damage (Figure 4B, top panel). Interestingly, RB loss had no significant effects upon gammaH2AX foci intensity among images of the cell population taken at equal exposures following IR damage.

Ad-GFP infected MAFs were treated with 0, 10, 20 J/m2 UV and propagated in culture while being pulse labeled with BrdU prior to harvest at 4 and 24 h. Detection of BrdU incorporation revealed the ability of RB-proficient cells to significantly recover from the UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint and resume cell cycle progression. The percentage of BrdU positive cells significantly increased from 4 to 24 h following each dose of UV damage as compared with untreated controls (set to 100%) (Figure 4C). To monitor the induction of UV lesions in the single-cell, the abundance of 6-4 PPs was examined by immunofluorescence immediately following damage (T = 0 h) and after 24 h of recovery (T = 24 h) (Figure 4D). These lesions are clearly induced in MAFs by 10 J/m2 UV at T = 0 h and are largely resolved by 24 h. To more closely examine the kinetics of 6-4 PP repair, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells were treated with 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV and harvested for 6-4 PP analysis at 0, 2, 5 and 24 h following damage. The average pixel intensities of images taken at equal exposures were compared using Metamorph software and displayed graphically to reveal that RB-deficient cells exhibit a kinetic difference in the loss of 6-4 PP staining intensities, as compared with RB-proficient cells (Figure 4E, top panel). To ensure that acceleration of 6-4 PP resolution was not due to infection with Ad-GFP-Cre, wild-type MAF control cells retaining Rb were cultured and infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre as before. Wild-type cells were treated with UV and monitored for 6-4 PP repair as in the top panel of Figure 4E, to reveal that it is indeed RB loss which enhances 6-4 PP repair rather than Ad-GFP-Cre infection (Figure 4E, bottom panel).

PCNA is an interesting repair factor, not only because it is regulated by RB, but also because it performs dual activities upon recruitment to chromatin in DNA replication and DNA repair. Therefore, to dissect the significance of PCNA involvement in UV damage repair, chromatin extractions were performed on Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs at 0, 3 and 5 h following UV treatment. Next, PCNA immunofluorescence was used to determine the percent of cells in the population that exhibited chromatin tethered PCNA with respect to unextracted controls. RB-proficient cell populations exhibited a slight decrease in PCNA chromatin tethering from 0 to 3 h followed by a marked increase by 5 h following damage (Figure 6A). In contrast, PCNA engagement with chromatin was accelerated in the RB-deficient populations, peaking at 3 h and becoming similar to Ad-GFP infected controls by 5 h post-damage. In confirmation with previous studies, these results reveal an increase in PCNA tethering following UV exposure, indicating the involvement of PCNA in nucleotide excision repair. In addition, this involvement in repair is accelerated in RB-deficient cells. These experiments also revealed differential PCNA chromatin tethering patterns within the nuclei of cells following UV damage, which indicated that a shift in PCNA function was occurring during UV damage repair (Figure 6B). Approximately 90% of tethered PCNA staining appeared in large foci in undamaged cells, indicative of replication foci (Figure 6C). However, 3 h after exposure to 10 J/m2 UV, nearly 100% of both RB-proficient and -deficient populations of cells exhibited diffuse small punctate patterns of PCNA tethering within the nucleus. The global nature of this PCNA staining pattern suggests that PCNA function has shifted to repair foci at this time point. Strikingly, 5 h post-UV damage, nearly 100% of Ad-GFP infected cells continue to exhibit diffuse punctate PCNA chromatin tethering while more than 75% of Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells demonstrate localized focal patterning, as observed in the undamaged state. These data indicate that the RB-deficient cells are able to initiate UV-induced damage repair with enhanced kinetics and that in these cells the PCNA distribution more rapidly shifted its association with repair foci to replication foci following damage.",

Several models have been proposed which aim to describe how RB could be functioning to inhibit cell cycle progression following DNA damage. One model places RB in direct contact with replication machinery to inhibit replication, while another suggests that RB inhibits replication indirectly, via repression of downstream targets. Kinetic analysis of the DNA damage response in MAFs allowed us to probe the nature of RB function in checkpoint activation. Our data indicates that downstream targets such as PCNA, cyclin A and MCM-7 are not repressed by RB during the induction of the rapid cell cycle checkpoint (Figure 2). This data a priori supports the first model, wherein RB acts directly to inhibit replication and arrest cell cycle following recognition of DNA damage. However, it is equally possible that the vast target gene deregulation, which occurs concomitant with RB loss, facilitates checkpoint bypass. In an attempt to differentiate these possibilities, we closely examined the kinetics of RB deletion and DNA damage response in adult cells. Results presented indicate that RB loss is intimately coupled with target deregulation, together facilitating checkpoint abrogation (Figure 3). Thus, either model of RB function in checkpoint induction could be appropriate, in that RB loss prevents its direct action in replication inhibition while concurrently disrupting its function in control of downstream transcriptional targets.",

Although many of the downstream pathway components in the G1/S checkpoint are involved in signaling from both UV and IR induced lesions, many of the initial upstream components vary. In the case of IR-induced DNA double-strand break signaling, ATM kinase activity is immediately stimulated to phosphorylate a number of downstream effectors including histone H2AX, p53 and chk2. Similarly, ATM and the rad 3 related (ATR) protein senses UV damage and participates in signal transduction via phosphorylation of many of the same effectors as ATM, such as chk2 and p53. Our studies reveal that rapid phosphorylation of H2AX and p53 following IR and UV (p53 only) are not compromised by acute RB loss, despite the observed impairment of DNA damage checkpoint function (Figure 2).

          "text": "As the function of DNA damage signaling effectors were unaffected by RB loss, we sought to understand the consequence of the differential DNA damage checkpoint function on the cellular response to DNA damage. Because control cells exhibiting a functional checkpoint were able to resume cell cycle progression 24 h following damage, we assumed that these cells must have been able to repair a significant portion of the DNA lesions. Thus, we sought to monitor the actual induction and removal of these lesions imparted by IR and UV damage. Although monitoring the reduction in gammaH2AX to analyze DNA double-strand break repair following IR damage is rather qualitative, our studies revealed that RB did not play a dramatic role in IR-induced damage repair (Figure 4). This may suggest that participants in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway are upstream of the RB/E2F axis or that those repair factors deregulated via RB loss are not rate-limiting for repair. Next, we explored the role of RB in repair of UV-induced 6-4 PPs. Our investigations revealed that RB loss significantly accelerated removal of 6-4 PPs during the first 10 h following exposure to UV. However, by 24 h post-damage, the RB-proficient cells exhibited equal levels of lesion removal with the RB-deficient cells (Figures 4 and 5). This is the first evidence indicating that RB inactivation modifies DNA damage repair. The underlying mechanisms for this change could be multiple. First, recent evidence suggests that RB regulates the expression of several DNA damage repair factors involved in UV damage repair processes including: FEN1, XPC, RPA2-3, RFC4 and PCNA. As we found that the rate of repair of UV-induced damage was modified by RB loss, we investigated its effect upon the function of an RB-regulated UV damage repair factor, PCNA. We presume that high basal levels of proteins such as PCNA enable the RB-deficient cells to complete repair processes more quickly, as we found that PCNA protein expression rapidly shifted from diffuse punctate patterning (indicative of its function in repair) to focal expression (evident in normal replication) (Figure 6). Therefore, the observed UV repair factor dynamics are consistent with the kinetics of 6-4 PP lesion removal for each cell type. Second, the loss of cell cycle arrest following damage may initiate faster repair, modifying the conventional view of checkpoint function being necessary for efficient lesion resolution. Traditionally, DNA damage checkpoints are viewed as providing necessary time for recruitment of repair or apoptotic factors. However, due to the fact that RB-deficient cells demonstrate elevated basal levels of a variety of repair factors, recruitment time may inevitably be shortened, thereby eliminating the necessity for cell cycle arrest.",

          "text": "In summary, the data presented indicate that RB participates in the response to UV and IR damage signaling in a differential manner. Although RB loss abrogates the checkpoint in response to both forms of DNA damage, the consequence of this loss in each instance differs. Following IR, the loss of checkpoint function did not affect lesion repair. This suggests that RB-deficient cells were replicating in the presence of DNA damage for a prolonged period of time, possibly inducing secondary lesions which contribute to genomic instability and activation of apoptotic pathways. However, following UV, RB-deficient cells rapidly repaired 6-4 PPs, potentially limiting the accumulation of detrimental replication-mediated lesions. Although the consequences of checkpoint bypass have not been fully elucidated, there exist several possible influences of the observed rapid repair of UV lesions in RB-deficient cells. First, accelerated 6-4 PP repair kinetics may facilitate secondary lesion development, which would explain the clinical observations that RB-deficient tumor cells are more sensitive to death upon challenge and that hereditary retinoblastoma survivors are at an increased risk for melanoma. Second, loss of cell cycle arrest coupled with rapid 6-4 PP lesion repair may prevent proper activation of apoptotic cascades in cells harboring other UV-induced lesions (e.g. CPD), facilitating the propagation of mutations. Because all cells are assaulted by damaging environmental signals and a high proportion of RB-deficient cancers are treated with DNA damaging therapy, understanding the effect of RB inactivation on the response to DNA damage will enhance our perceptions of tumorigenesis and cancer therapeutics. Our results provide the framework for understanding the critical role of RB in the DNA damage response. These data indicate that RB is required for the rapid induction of cell cycle arrest following recognition of both UV and IR damage in adult primary cells. Additionally, RB loss in these cells is closely coupled with target gene deregulation and contributes to abrogation of checkpoint function. Lastly, we demonstrate that although damage signaling remains unaffected, RB loss accelerates UV lesion repair and modifies repair factor dynamics.",
