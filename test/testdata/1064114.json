ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) heterozygous deficiency has been proposed to increase susceptibility to breast cancer. However, those early studies were limited by the lack of reliable assays with which to identify carriers. In fact, in a later study a lack of association of heterozygous ATM mutations with early onset of breast cancer was found. More recent epidemiological studies suggested that missense mutation in the ATM gene, rather than a protein-truncating mutation, which accounts for the majority of mutations in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, confers increased risk for breast cancer. Thus, cancer risk in ATM heterozygotes varies depending on the mutation type (i.e. some missense-type mutations are associated with early onset of breast carcinoma whereas truncation-type mutations are not). Recently, epidemiological studies on excess risk for breast cancer in ATM heterozygosity were reported.",

Heterozygosity for a null knockout allele of Atm in mice and protein-truncating alleles of ATM in humans was thought not to increase susceptibility to mammary cancer.

Fourteen out of 28 p53+/- Atm+/- mice (50%) and seven out of 22 p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (32%) developed mammary carcinomas during the period of observation (Table 1, Fig. 2). The incidence of mammary carcinomas in p53+/- Atm+/- mice appeared to be higher than that in p53+/- Atm+/+ mice, but the incidences did not differ significantly between Atm+/- and Atm+/+ genotypes (P = 0.32, by Fisher's exact probability test). Among the tumours that developed in the p53+/- mice, mammary carcinoma were the most common. These mammary carcinomas were mainly observed at 41-77 weeks after birth (Fig. 2). No significant difference in latency in the nonirradiated groups was observed between doubly heterozygous mice and p53 singly heterozygous mice (P = 0.47, by unpaired Student's t-test). None of 11 p53+/+ Atm+/- mice and 25 p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice developed mammary carcinomas. Several lymphomas and a few other tumours developed in the four genotypes (Table 1). Thus, mammary carcinoma development depended strongly on p53 heterozygous deficiency in (BALB/c x MSM/Ms)F1 mice, and p53+/- mice of both Atm+/+ and Atm+/- genotypes developed mammary carcinoma.",

Only one out of 53 p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice and none of 47 p53+/+ Atm+/- mice developed mammary carcinoma, indicating that almost all p53+/+ mice fail to develop mammary carcinomas, despite X-irradiation and irrespective of Atm gene status. In contrast, 32 out of 55 p53+/- Atm+/- mice (58%) and 19 out of 61 p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (31%) developed mammary carcinomas (Table 2, Fig. 2). The proportion of mice developing mammary carcinomas in the p53+/- Atm+/- group was significantly greater than that in the p53+/- Atm+/+ group (P = 0.0034, by chi2 test). A total of 52 mammary carcinomas developed in 55 p53+/- Atm+/- mice (average number of mammary carcinomas/mouse = 0.95), whereas 28 mammary carcinoma developed in 61 p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (average number of mammary carcinomas/mouse = 0.46; Table 2). The average number of mammary carcinomas per mouse in the p53+/- Atm+/- group was significantly greater than that in p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (P = 0.0052, by Mann-Whitney U-test). Thus, Atm heterozygous deficiency enhanced development of mammary carcinoma in irradiated p53 heterozygous knockout mice. Spring and coworkers observed no tumours in Atm knockout (Atm+/-) heterozygous mice. Mice bearing a knockout allele of Atm and humans carrying a mutant allele of truncated type in the ATM gene have been shown not to have obviously elevated susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis. Our findings show that heterozygosity for a null knockout allele of Atm enhances mammary carcinogenesis under p53+/- status, although the Atm mutation is not a dominant-negative type. Heterozygous deficiency of p53 might make clear the effect on mammary carcinogenesis of haploinsufficiency in the Atm gene.",

The mean (+- standard deviation) latency periods were 32.6 +- 4.8 and 29.8 +- 3.6 weeks in p53+/- Atm+/- and p53+/- Atm+/+ mice, respectively. Thus, X-irradiation at 5 Gy at age 5 weeks considerably shortened the latency period of mammary carcinoma development in these two groups with different genotypes. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the incidences of mammary carcinoma in p53+/- Atm+/- mice were 58% (32 out of 55) and 50% (14 out of 28) in irradiated and nonirradiated groups, respectively; in p53+/- Atm+/+ mice the incidence in the irradiated group was 31% (19 out of 61) and that in the nonirradiated group was 32% (7 out of 22).

Wild-type Atm allele was also retained in nine out of 10 mammary carcinomas from nonirradiated Atm+/- mice and in all of five mammary carcinomas from nonirradiated Atm+/+ mice.

Heterozygosity for the Nbn knockout allele rendered the mice susceptible to tumour development, yet the Nbn wild-type allele was fully retained in all 12 tumours examined. p27 heterozygotes are also predisposed to tumours in multiple tissues when challenged with irradiation or a chemical carcinogen, and in the developed tumours the remaining wild-type allele is neither mutated nor silenced, indicating that p27 is haploinsufficient for tumour suppression. In that study, heterozygous Atm knockout enhanced mammary carcinoma development in p53-heterozygous deficient mice, but the effect of Atm deficiency was not as profound. A previous study showed that heterozygosity for the Atm knockout allele did not enhance tumour development but that dominant-negative type missense mutations in the Atm gene did. In humans, heterozygosity of the truncation-type mutations, which represent the majority of Atm mutations that occur in humans, had no effect on carcinogenesis, suggesting that enhancement in tumourigenesis depends strongly on mutation type. However, in the present study we demonstrated that haploinsufficiency does occur for the Atm null allele in combination with heterozygous deficiency in the p53 gene. The p53 heterozygous deficient BALB/c mice, which developed mammary carcinomas early and efficiently, may represent a useful model for the study of effects of genes other than Atm on mammary carcinogenesis. F1 mice between different subspecies may also provide an experimental system for precise genome-wide allelotype analysis of genes that cooperate with p53.",

In the present study we tested the effect of haploinsufficiency of the Atm gene on mammary tumourigenesis after X-irradiation in p53+/- mice of the BALB/cHeA x MSM/Ms background. Singly heterozygous p53+/- mice X-irradiated (5 Gy) at age 5 weeks developed mammary carcinomas at around 25 weeks of age, and the final incidence of mammary carcinoma at 39 weeks was 31% (19 out of 61). Introduction of the heterozygous Atm alleles into the background of the p53+/- genotype significantly increased the incidence of mammary carcinomas to 58% (32 out of 55) and increased the average number of mammary carcinomas per mouse. However, it apparently did not change the latency of mammary carcinoma development. In nonirradiated mice, introduction of the Atm+/- allele into p53+/- mice also tended to increase spontaneous incidence of mammary carcinoma. In contrast, almost none of the p53+/+ mice developed mammary carcinoma, regardless of the Atm gene status and whether mice were subjected to irradiation. In almost all of the spontaneous and radiation-induced mammary carcinomas, the wild-type p53 allele was found to be lost whereas the wild-type Atm allele was retained, suggesting haploinsufficiency of the latter gene in mammary carcinoma development. Thus, doubly heterozygous mice represent a useful model system with which to analyze the interaction of heterozygous genotypes for p53, Atm and other genes and their effect on mammary carcinogenesis.",
