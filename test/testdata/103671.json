Cold tolerant Brassica napus, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrated an increase in both subunit A mRNA and protein in response to chilling at 2 C. This chilling also resulted in a concomitant increase in cell sap osmotic pressure and endogenous ABA accumulation. These researchers indicated that Arabidopsis also was a cold tolerant plant which exhibited a similar response with respect to V-ATPase subunit A mRNA, however they provided no data. In rice (Oryza sativa) chilling plants at 10 C resulted in a two fold increase in vacuolar type ATPase activity evaluated by in vitro assay of isolated membranes. This study did not analyze changes in protein level in the isolated membranes in response to chilling. Cold sensitive mung bean seedlings (Vigna radiata) subjected to chilling at 4 C for 48 hours contrastingly showed no increase in vacuolar type ATPase activity in isolated membranes.

Subjecting plants to 400 mM NaCl resulted in an approximately two fold increase in the transcript levels of subunits A, B, and the proteolipid in roots prior to the shift to Crassulacean acid metabolism. Fully expanded leaves exhibited an increase only for the proteolipid mRNA, an increase of approximately three fold over non salt stressed plants. Cell suspension cultures when subjected to salt stress exhibited increase in activity of both P-Type and V-Type ATPases without concomitant increase in protein levels. Transcript levels of subunit E of the V-ATPase in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum were recently shown to increase in leaves but not roots of salt stressed plants with a concomitant increase in protein levels in leaves. On the other hand, subunit E in Hordeum vulgare showed no effect on mRNA level in response to salt stress. The effects of salt stress on V-ATPases has also been investigated in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) suspension cells. Subjecting NaCl adapted cells to salt stress resulted in an approximately four fold increase in both proton transport and ATP hydrolysis on isolated membranes compared to unadapted cells. Remarkably this increase in overall V-ATPase activity coincided with an apparent reduction in the amount of enzyme on the tonoplast. This apparently contradictory finding may be the result of physical changes in the enzyme itself or changes in the lipid environment. Especially confounding is the finding that mRNA levels for subunit A increase two to four fold in response to the same levels of salt stress in tobacco suspension cells. Experiments with tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) showed similar results with respect to induction of mRNA for subunit A with an approximately two to four fold increase seen with respect to salt stress. Recent work in the resurrection plant Tortula ruralis indicated that transcript levels of the proteolipid (subunit c) increased in response to salt stress but that there was no corresponding increase in protein levels.",

Vacuolar type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes critical for the maintenance of homeostasis. Therefore, it is expected that all living plant cells require V-ATPase function. Since A. thaliana seemed to possess only a single gene for subunit A of the V-ATPase it was expected that this gene should be expressed in all organs tested. Whole RNA was harvested from leaves, bolts, siliques, flowers, axenically grown seedlings, and axenically grown roots. RNA was denatured with glyoxal, fractionated via agarose gel electrophoresis, and immobilized on a positively charged nylon membrane. Hybridization was conducted at high stringency with a 1700 base pair homologous cDNA probe labeled with digoxigenin. In agreement with our expectations, results indicated high levels of expression in all organs tested (Fig. 2) with slightly higher levels of subunit A mRNA present in seedlings. This is most likely due to the fact that seedlings are the most rapidly growing and metabolizing stage of the plant tested. Seedlings are undergoing dramatic and rapid vacuole biogenesis to allow for rapid growth at this stage of development and therefore would be expected to require a higher level of subunit A expression than other more terminally differentiated organs. Roots, leaves, bolts, and flowers showed approximately equivalent amounts of signal with somewhat lower levels in siliques.",

The goal was to determine if any of the four were differentially expressed in response to stress. A PCR based approach was taken to evaluate transcript levels for the four different subunit A mRNAs. Primer pairs were designed (Table 1) that would only amplify one of the four transcripts. This was accomplished by anchoring the downstream primer in the poly (A) tail. The upstream primer was located in the coding region of the subunit A cDNA. Anchoring the downstream primer in the poly (A) tail prevented that oligonucleotide from priming at any other site since 10 out of 18 nucleotides were T's at the 5' end. The primer pairs were designed such that the four amplification products would differ in size by approximately 100 base pairs for ease of visualization on agarose gels and blots (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). Primer pair T-11 and T-12 corresponds to transcript-1 and produce an amplification product of 579 base pairs. Primer pair T-21 and T-22 corresponds to transcript-2 and amplify a band of 455 base pairs. Primers T-31 and T-32 correspond to transcript-3 and amplify a 362 base pair product. Lastly, primer pair T-41 and T-42 corresponds to transcript-4 and produce a 238 base pair amplification product. The transcript-4 amplification product, which is the smallest and nested within the other three, acted as probe to detect all four transcripts. This nesting was accomplished to avoid differences in signal during hybridization based on different probe lengths and labeling efficiency.",

Similarly, treatment of plants at six degrees for four days resulted in a similar increase in signal for all four transcripts. Etiolation resulted in slightly higher message levels for transcripts -1, -2, and -3 compared to controls. The lesser degree of increase for transcript-3 might be due to near saturation of the signal. The latter might be due to the higher abundance of the transcript, or due to more efficient amplification of the transcript-3 primer set. Transcript-4 seems to show slightly less signal than control plants but the autoradiograph is somewhat under developed. These results are in agreement with the whole RNA stress blot analysis. Apparent quantitative differences in upregulation between transcripts shown in (Fig. 7) might be due to differential amplification efficiency of the four different primer sets and do not necessarily represent true differential upregulation of the four transcripts.

The small size of the A. thaliana genome may be indicative of a trend toward streamlining of DNA in this plant, which may have eliminated a redundant subunit A gene over evolutionary time.
