          "text": "Hydroxyl radical is one of the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed from gamma-radiolysis of water or Fenton reaction, and it can abstract one hydrogen atom from the methyl carbon atom of thymine and 5-methylcytosine to give the 5-methyl radical of the pyrimidine bases. The latter radical can also be induced from Type-I photo-oxidation process. Here, we examined the reactivity of the independently generated 5-(2'-deoxycytidyl)methyl radical (I) in single- and double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs). It was found that an intrastrand cross-link lesion, in which the methyl carbon atom of 5-methylcytosine and the C8 carbon atom of guanine are covalently bonded, could be formed from the independently generated radical at both GmC and mCG sites, with the yield being much higher at the former site. We also showed by LC-MS/MS that the same cross-link lesions were formed in mC-containing duplex ODNs upon gamma irradiation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the yield was ~10-fold higher under the latter conditions. The independently generated radical allows for the availability of pure, sufficient and well-characterized intrastrand cross-link lesion-bearing ODN substrates for future biochemical and biophysical characterizations. This was also the first demonstration that the coupling of radical I with its 5' neighboring guanine can occur in the presence of molecular oxygen, suggesting that the formation of this and other types of intrastrand cross-link lesions might have important implications in the cytotoxic effects of ROS.",

          "text": "DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in a number of human pathological conditions. In this regard, hydroxyl radical is the major ROS formed from Fenton reaction or gamma-radiolysis of water. It is well documented that hydroxyl radical can react with thymine and 5-methylcytosine by either adding to the C5 = C6 double bond or abstracting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group. The hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group, which gives rise to the methyl radical of the pyrimidine bases (Scheme 1, I), accounts for ~10% of the secondary radical products of the pyrimidine bases formed from gamma irradiation. Quantification of various thymidine oxidation products originating from the gamma irradiation of isolated or cellular DNA, however, indicated that, in the duplex DNA environment, the  OH may attack the methyl carbon atom more frequently than the C5, C6 carbon atoms. Other than the  OH attack, one-electron photo-oxidation of pyrimidine nucleosides leads to the formation of the cation radical of the nucleosides, which, upon deprotonation, can also give rise to radical I (Scheme 1). The methyl radical formed from those oxidation processes may react with the neighboring nucleobase to form intrastrand cross-link lesions (Scheme 1).",

          "text": "The independent generation of reactive intermediates of nucleosides, especially those from their photolabile precursors, facilitates the investigation of the roles of these reactive intermediates in DNA damage. This approach offers a distinctive advantage over the use of ionizing radiation, Fenton reaction or other oxidative DNA damage agents, in which multiple reactive intermediates are formed. A number of radical intermediates, such as the 5,6-dihydrothymid-5-yl radical, the 5,6-dihydrourid-6-yl radical, the 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymid-6-yl radical, the 5-(pyrimidyl)methyl radical and radicals on C1', C3' and C4', have been synthesized and their reactivities have been examined. Recently, we reported the efficient generation of the 5-methyl radical of mC from the 254 nm irradiation of 5-phenylthiomethyl-2'-deoxycytidine. We also showed that the independently generated I in dinucleoside monophosphates can result in the facile formation of two intrastrand cross-link lesions (mC  G and G  mC), in which the methyl carbon atom of 5-methylcytosine and the C8 carbon atom of its adjacent guanine are covalently bonded (Scheme 1). Moreover, we demonstrated that the cross-link lesion can be induced from gamma irradiation of d(mCG) under anaerobic conditions.",

Second, the site of cross-link can be established from the product-ion spectrum of the [M-3H]3- ion (m/z 1223.5) of the ODN without ambiguity. Upon collisional activation in a mass spectrometer, an ODN undergoes cleavages at the N-glycosidic bond and the 3' C-O bond of the same nucleotide to yield [an-base] and wn ions. The cleavage was proposed to be initiated from a proton transfer process. Because of the low proton affinity of thymine, chain cleavage at the 3' side of thymidine is less commonly observed. The production of two complementary pairs of ions, i.e. [a5-G]-/[w7 + G]2- and  (Figure 2a), demonstrates that the guanine at the fifth position is covalently linked with 5-methylcytosine at the sixth position because a6 and [w7 + G] ions can only be produced when the two nucleobases are cross-linked (Figure 2b).

The formation of the cross-link lesion under aerobic conditions shows that the coupling of reactive intermediate I to its neighboring 5' guanine base is in competition with its coupling to molecular oxygen (Scheme 2). In support of this argument, we showed that the yield for the formation of G  mC is apparently lower while the ODN solution is saturated with molecular oxygen before gamma irradiation (Table 1).",

It is reasonable to expect that the molecular oxygen is partially consumed during the gamma irradiation process. We, however, believe that it is very unlikely for the solution to be completely depleted of oxygen during the course of irradiation. Moreover, our above results for the UV irradiation under constant O2 bubbling conditions demonstrate conclusively that the G  mC lesion can be formed under saturated O2 conditions (vide supra).",

We also examined the reactivities of the independently generated radical through product analysis. Our results showed that the G  mC cross-link lesion was formed more efficiently in single-stranded ODN than in duplex ODN upon UV-C irradiation. Furthermore, the efficiency for cross-linking is highly sequence-dependent. The G  mC lesion can be formed at a much higher yield than the mC  G lesion. Previous work by Bellon et al. showed that the analogous intrastrand cross-link lesion can be generated in d(GTG) and d(ATA) sequences from the UV-C irradiation of the corresponding precursor of 5-(2'-deoxyuridyl)-5-methyl radical. The results presented in this paper, however, demonstrated for the first time that the phenylthiolate-bearing nucleoside can facilitate the generation of pure, sufficient and well-characterized lesion-containing ODN substrates that can be readily used for examining the thermodynamic, replication and repair studies of the G  mC lesion.",

The respective mC  G cross-link lesion is formed with a yield that is >10-fold lower than the G  mC lesion under anaerobic conditions. To our knowledge, the formation of intrastrand oxidative cross-link lesion under aerobic conditions has never been shown previously. This result demonstrated that the coupling of reactive intermediate I with the neighboring guanine base can compete with its coupling to molecular oxygen, suggesting that this kind of lesion might be induced in cellular DNA by endogenous and/or exogenous ROS. Therefore, this kind of cross-link lesion may contribute significantly to the cytotoxic effect of ROS.",

          "text": "This study, together with previous investigations by Box, Cadet and us, demonstrates clearly that a single pyrimidine base radical is sufficient for inducing the formation of intrastrand cross-link lesions. This type of chemistry has been shown for all three types of secondary radicals formed from hydroxyl radical attack on pyridimine bases, i.e. the 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydropyrimid-6-yl, the 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydropyrimid-5-yl and the 5-(pyrimidyl)methyl radicals. In this respect, the methyl radical of thymine or 5-methylcytosine can couple with its neighboring purine bases to give intrastrand cross-link lesions. In addition, Box and co-workers identified a CG cross-link lesion from the gamma irradiation of d(CGTA) under anaerobic conditions, and the lesion was proposed to be initiated from the dehydration of the coupling product between 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrocytosin-5-yl radical and guanine. We showed recently that gamma irradiation of duplex DNA can induce the formation of this kind of lesion at 5'-GC-3', but not at 5'-CG-3' site. Moreover, we showed recently that both the 5S and 5R diastereomers of the 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidin-6-yl radical can couple with the C8 carbon atom of its 3' neighboring guanine to give cross-link lesions.",

In addition, among the six major mutational hotspots in human p53 gene (codons 175, 213, 245, 248, 273 and 282, which all contain methylated CpGs), cytosines in two of those codons, i.e. codons 175 (CGC) and 273 (CGT), have a 5' flanking guanine (the last base in codon 272 is a guanine). Therefore, the G  mC lesion, which forms at a much higher yield than the mC  G lesion, may also contribute to CpG mutagenesis. It is worth noting that, because of the absence of the methyl group, radical I cannot be generated on an unmethylated cytosine, underscoring the potential importance of cytosine methylation in intrastrand cross-link lesion formation and high mutation frequency observed at CpG sites. To further explore this possibility, we will need to demonstrate the formation of this lesion in vivo and to examine the mutagenic properties of this lesion. In this respect, the availability of the authentic G  mC lesion in both dinucleoside monophosphate and ODNs facilitates these studies.",
