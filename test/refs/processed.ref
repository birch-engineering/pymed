ALL REAGENTS WERE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE
ALL THE HYBRIDIZATION AND ENZYMATIC DATA INDICATE THAT SEVEN NITROINDOLE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A CLEAVABLE BASE ANALOG ALTHOUGH NOT STRICTLY FULFILLING LIKE THE FIVE NITRO ISOMER ALL PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR A UNIVERSAL BASE
ALL THOSE HYBRIDIZATION AND ENZYMATIC DATA INDICATE THAT THIS NEWLY INTRODUCED SEVEN NITROINDOLE NUCLEOSIDE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A PHOTOCHEMICALLY CLEAVABLE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG

ALTERED DISTRIBUTION OF LAMIN B FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO THE FTI WAS INVESTIGATED IN HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN A  FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE AND MIAPACA  TWO CELLS
ALTERNATIVELY EFFECTIVE DNA REPAIR WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM
ALTERNATIVELY HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN TREATED CELLS WERE INCUBATED WITH ZERO POINT TWO MUG ML COLCEMID FOR ONE H WASHED TWICE WITH HBSS AND ALLOWED TO SWELL FOR THIRTY MIN IN SEVENTY FIVE MM KCL HYPOTONIC SOLUTION
ALTERNATIVELY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FAST H RELEASE WE OBSERVE FROM PR AT PH NINE POINT FIVE MAY DIFFER FROM THAT IN BR ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT IN PR THE RELEASED PROTON COULD COME DIRECTLY FROM THE CHROMOPHORE COUNTERION ASP  NINETY SEVEN
ALTHOUGH ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED ATM HETEROZYGOUS DEFICIENCY HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO INCREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BREAST CANCER SOME STUDIES HAVE NOT FOUND EXCESS RISK
ALTHOUGH CELLS OF THESE PATIENTS ARE HIGHLY RADIOSENSITIVE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER IN AT PATIENTS IS NOT CLEAR BECAUSE THESE PATIENTS OFTEN DIE YOUNG BEFORE REACHING THE AGES AT WHICH MOST BREAST CANCERS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION USUALLY ARISE
ALTHOUGH IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT RB FUNCTION IS NECESSARY FOR PROPER REGULATION OF DOWNSTREAM TARGETS AND THE DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINT RESPONSE THE KINETIC ORDERING OF THESE EVENTS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED
ALTHOUGH LOW PENETRANCE DNA REPAIR GENES REPRESENT AN AREA OF ACTIVE RESEARCH CURRENTLY AVAILABLE STUDIES TYPICALLY REPORT MAIN EFFECTS OF THE DNA REPAIR GENE POLYMORPHISMS
ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE DOWNSTREAM PATHWAY COMPONENTS IN THE G ONE S CHECKPOINT ARE INVOLVED IN SIGNALING FROM BOTH UV AND IR INDUCED LESIONS MANY OF THE INITIAL UPSTREAM COMPONENTS VARY

ALTHOUGH RB LOSS ABROGATES THE CHECKPOINT IN RESPONSE TO BOTH FORMS OF DNA DAMAGE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LOSS IN EACH INSTANCE DIFFERS
ALTHOUGH THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHECKPOINT BYPASS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED THERE EXIST SEVERAL POSSIBLE INFLUENCES OF THE OBSERVED RAPID REPAIR OF UV LESIONS IN RB DEFICIENT CELLS
ALTHOUGH THE ROLE OF GENETIC FACTORS IN RADIATION RELATED BREAST CANCER IS OF GREAT INTEREST IT IS VERY CHALLENGING TO STUDY EXCEPT FOR A LIKELY ROLE OF THE ATM GENE SO FAR FEW OTHER GENETIC RISK FACTORS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
ALTHOUGH THE ROLES OF THESE GENES REMAIN TO BE ELUCIDATED LOSS OF FUNCTION IN BOTH ALLELES SEEMS TO BE NECESSARY FOR THE CHARACTERISTIC INCREASED RISK OF EARLY ONSET BREAST CANCER
ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE ATM GENE HAS A ROLE IN BREAST CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY AND IN RADIOSENSITIVITY THERE AS YET IS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE FOR AN INCREASED RISK OF RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER AMONG ATM HETEROZYGOTES
ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE SUGGESTIVE OF AN EFFECT THE NUMBERS OF CASES ARE TOO SMALL TO PROVIDE CONVINCING EVIDENCE
ALTHOUGH TUMORS DEFICIENT IN BRCA ONE AND BRCA TWO SHOW MARKED SENSITIVITY TO IONIZING RADIATION AND DRUGS THAT PRODUCE DSBS SEVERAL CELL BASED STUDIES OF BRCA ONE AND BRCA TWO MUTATION CARRIERS FAILED TO SHOW INCREASED RADIOSENSITIVITY
ALTOGETHER IRRADIATION MARKEDLY HASTENED MAMMARY CARCINOMA DEVELOPMENT IN THE P FIFTY THREE PLUS MICE IN WHICH MAMMARY CARCINOMAS DEVELOPED SPONTANEOUSLY

AS SHOWN IN THE RESULTS SOME DIGESTIONS WERE ALSO PERFORMED WITH NUCLEASE P ONE AND CIP ONLY AND THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE THE SAME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE EXCEPT THAT NO PHOSPHODIESTERASE AND NO BUFFER SOLUTION WERE ADDED
AS SUCH THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURE THAT PLACES RB DOWNSTREAM OF H TWO AX AND P FIFTY THREE PHOSPHORYLATION IN THE DNA DAMAGE SIGNALING AND REPAIR PATHWAY
AS THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN DSBS IS UNFOLDING IT IS BECOMING CLEAR THAT THESE ARE NOT ENTIRELY DISTINCT PROCESSES BECAUSE SOME PROTEINS FOR EXAMPLE THOSE ENCODED BY THE GENES ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA MUTATED ATM BRCA ONE AND BRCA TWO MIGHT HAVE A ROLE IN BOTH HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION AND NHEJ
AS THE FUNCTION OF DNA DAMAGE SIGNALING EFFECTORS WERE UNAFFECTED BY RB LOSS WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINT FUNCTION ON THE CELLULAR RESPONSE TO DNA DAMAGE

BEARING IN MIND THAT RADICAL I CAN ALSO COUPLE READILY WITH MOLECULAR OXYGEN AND THAT THE RESULTING PEROXYL RADICAL CAN BE TRANSFORMED TO GIVE SINGLE NUCLEOBASE LESIONS I E FIVE FORMYLCYTOSINE AND FIVE HYDROXYMETHYL CYTOSINE SCHEME TWO WE NEXT EXAMINED WHETHER RADICAL I CAN ALSO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF THE G MC UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS
BECAUSE A WILD TYPE LEVEL OF FUSION WAS OBSERVED IN UNILATERAL CROSSES RATHER THAN AN EXPECTED FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION THERE MUST ALSO BE CROSS TALK BETWEEN THE TWO CELLS PRIOR TO FUSION WHICH IS PROBABLY MEDIATED VIA PHEROMONE SENSING
BECAUSE ALL CELLS ARE ASSAULTED BY DAMAGING ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNALS AND A HIGH PROPORTION OF RB DEFICIENT CANCERS ARE TREATED WITH DNA DAMAGING THERAPY UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF RB INACTIVATION ON THE RESPONSE TO DNA DAMAGE WILL ENHANCE OUR PERCEPTIONS OF TUMORIGENESIS AND CANCER THERAPEUTICS
BECAUSE AT IS A RECESSIVE DISORDER A SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER PROPORTION ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THE POPULATION COMPRISES SO CALLED HETEROZYGOUS CARRIERS OF AN ATM MUTATION IN ONLY ONE OF THE TWO COPIES OF THE GENE
BECAUSE CONTROL CELLS EXHIBITING A FUNCTIONAL CHECKPOINT WERE ABLE TO RESUME CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION TWENTY FOUR H FOLLOWING DAMAGE WE ASSUMED THAT THESE CELLS MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPAIR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE DNA LESIONS
BECAUSE FILAMENT FORMATION IS A QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN A QUANTITIVE PHENOTYPE AUXOTROPHIC DERIVATIVES OF BWC ONE WILD TYPE AND BWC ONE MUTANT STRAINS WERE CREATED AND CELL FUSION WAS ASSAYED QUANTITATIVELY FUSION OF TWO AUXOTROPHIC PARENTS ADE TWO OR LYS ONE YIELDS PROTOTROPHIC DIKARYOTIC OR DIPLOID STRAINS THAT CAN GROW ON MEDIUM LACKING ADENINE AND LYSINE
BECAUSE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATM MUTATIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SO FAR AND MORE PROBABLY REMAIN TO BE DISCOVERED IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT ATM MUTATIONS INVOLVED WITH INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER AMONG ATM HETEROZYGOTES MIGHT BE OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM THE ATM MUTATIONS FOUND IN MOST ALTHOUGH NOT ALL AT PATIENTS
BECAUSE OF THE LOW PROTON AFFINITY OF THYMINE CHAIN CLEAVAGE AT THE THREE SIDE OF THYMIDINE IS LESS COMMONLY OBSERVED

HERE WE EXAMINED THE REACTIVITY OF THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED FIVE  TWO DEOXYCYTIDYL METHYL RADICAL I IN SINGLE AND DOUBLE STRANDED OLIGODEOXYRIBONUCLEOTIDES ODNS
HERE WE EXTENDED OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE REACTIVITY OF THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED RADICAL I SCHEME ONE IN BOTH SINGLE AND DOUBLE STRANDED OLIGODEOXYRIBONUCLEOTIDES ODNS
HERE WE REPORT THAT RB FUNCTION IS CRITICAL FOR INDUCTION OF A RAPID CELL CYCLE CHECKPOINT IN RESPONSE TO THESE AGENTS
HERE WE UTILIZED A CONDITIONAL KNOCKOUT SYSTEM TO ABLATE RB IN ADULT FIBROBLASTS
HETEROZYGOSITY FOR A NULL KNOCKOUT ALLELE OF ATM IN MICE AND PROTEIN TRUNCATING ALLELES OF ATM IN HUMANS WAS THOUGHT NOT TO INCREASE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MAMMARY CANCER
HETEROZYGOSITY FOR THE NBN KNOCKOUT ALLELE RENDERED THE MICE SUSCEPTIBLE TO TUMOUR DEVELOPMENT YET THE NBN WILD TYPE ALLELE WAS FULLY RETAINED IN ALL TWELVE TUMOURS EXAMINED
HETEROZYGOUS DEFICIENCY OF P FIFTY THREE MIGHT MAKE CLEAR THE EFFECT ON MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS OF HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY IN THE ATM GENE
HIGHLY PENETRANT MUTATIONS IN THE HERITABLE BREAST CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES BRCA ONE AND BRCA TWO ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAMILY HISTORY AND BREAST CANCER RISK WHEREAS OTHER INHERITED GENETIC TRAITS HABITS AND SHARED ENVIRONMENT ARE ALSO LIKELY CONTRIBUTORS
HODGKIN LYMPHOMA LSS EQUAL TO

HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION IS AN ACCURATE PROCESS IN WHICH THE UNAFFECTED CHROMATID IS USED AS TEMPLATE HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION HOWEVER IS LESS FREQUENTLY USED THAN NHEJ AN ERROR PRONE PROCESS OF ILLEGITIMATELY LINKING THE BROKEN PIECES BACK TOGETHER WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ACCURATE BASE PAIRING
HOWEVER A RECENT LARGE STUDY AMONG SURVIVORS OF HODGKIN LYMPHOMA HL DID NOT SHOW CLEAR EVIDENCE OF SUCH FLATTENING ALTHOUGH THESE PATIENTS GENERALLY ARE EXPOSED TO VERY HIGH CHEST DOSES
HOWEVER A ROLE FOR RB IN REPAIR HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE FINDING THAT SEVERAL RB E TWO F REGULATED GENES ARE INVOLVED IN THE REPAIR OF UV AND IR DAMAGE
HOWEVER AD GFP CRE INFECTED MAFS EXHIBITED A GREATER REDUCTION IN SIX  FOUR PP LESIONS SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT AS COMPARED WITH CELLS INFECTED WITH AD GFP CONTROL TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AT FIVE AND TEN H POST TREATMENT FIGURE FIVE A BOTTOM PANEL INDICATING THAT RB LOSS CONTRIBUTES TO THE INCREASED KINETICS OF UV DAMAGE INDUCED LESION REPAIR
HOWEVER BECAUSE THE YOUNGEST AT EXPOSURE WERE FOLLOWED UP UNTIL A MUCH YOUNGER ADULT AGE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY DEVELOPED MORE BREAST TUMORS AFTER THE STUDY CUT OFF DATE
HOWEVER BY FORTY H POST INFECTION THE CHECKPOINT RESPONSE BECAME IMPAIRED FIGURE THREE C TOP PANEL CONCURRENT WITH MAXIMAL DEREGULATION OF TARGET GENES FOLLOWING RB PROTEIN LOSS FIGURE THREE A
HOWEVER BY TWENTY FOUR H POST DAMAGE THE RB PROFICIENT CELLS EXHIBITED EQUAL LEVELS OF LESION REMOVAL WITH THE RB DEFICIENT CELLS FIGURES FOUR AND FIVE
HOWEVER DAMP DGMP AND DTMP WERE MORE EFFICIENTLY INCORPORATED WHEN FACING D  SEVEN NI THAN D  FIVE NI
HOWEVER DROUGHT STRESS IN LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM RESULTED IN NO APPARENT INCREASE IN MRNA LEVELS FOR SUBUNIT A
HOWEVER DUE TO THE FACT THAT RB DEFICIENT CELLS DEMONSTRATE ELEVATED BASAL LEVELS OF A VARIETY OF REPAIR FACTORS RECRUITMENT TIME MAY INEVITABLY BE SHORTENED THEREBY ELIMINATING THE NECESSITY FOR CELL CYCLE ARREST
HOWEVER EAR WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR SWEDISH THIRTY TWO TWENTY ONE  FORTY SEVEN AND US FIFTEEN SEVEN POINT SEVEN  TWENTY FOUR WOMEN GIVEN RADIATION THERAPY FOR BBD AND SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER FOR TWO POPULATIONS OF SWEDISH WOMEN TREATED AS INFANTS WITH X RAYS AND RADIUM PLAQUES FOR HEMANGIOMA POOLED ESTIMATE FIVE POINT ONE ONE POINT THREE  ELEVEN FOR EXPOSURE AT SIX MONTHS OF AGE
HOWEVER ENHANCED RADIATION RESPONSE BY FTI  TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN HUMAN CELLS EXPRESSING WILD TYPE RAS TOGETHER WITH THE TWENTY FOUR KDA ISOFORM FGF TWO OF BASIC FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR A FACTOR INVOLVED IN ACQUIRED RADIORESISTANCE
HOWEVER EXTENSION WAS MORE EFFICIENT WITH TEMPLATE CONTAINING D  SEVEN NI
HOWEVER FOLLOWING UV RB DEFICIENT CELLS RAPIDLY REPAIRED SIX  FOUR PPS POTENTIALLY LIMITING THE ACCUMULATION OF DETRIMENTAL REPLICATION MEDIATED LESIONS
HOWEVER FOR PR MEASURED DIRECTLY IN CRUDE E COLI MEMBRANES I E NOT SOLUBILIZED IN OG WE OBTAINED THE SAME VALUE FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NM AS REPORTED PREVIOUSLY
HOWEVER IF REPAIRED INCORRECTLY DSBS CAN LEAD TO CARCINOGENESIS THROUGH TRANSLOCATIONS INVERSIONS OR DELETIONS OF GENETIC MATERIAL
HOWEVER IN PR A HOMOLOG OF ONLY ONE OF THESE THREE RESIDUES THE ARGININE IS PRESENT
HOWEVER IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE DEMONSTRATED THAT HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY DOES OCCUR FOR THE ATM NULL ALLELE IN COMBINATION WITH HETEROZYGOUS DEFICIENCY IN THE P FIFTY THREE GENE
HOWEVER INTRODUCTION OF ATM ALLELES DID NOT CHANGE THE LATENCY OF DEVELOPMENT OF MAMMARY CARCINOMA
HOWEVER IT APPARENTLY DID NOT CHANGE THE LATENCY OF MAMMARY CARCINOMA DEVELOPMENT
HOWEVER IT IS EQUALLY POSSIBLE THAT THE VAST TARGET GENE DEREGULATION WHICH OCCURS CONCOMITANT WITH RB LOSS FACILITATES CHECKPOINT BYPASS
HOWEVER IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT INHIBITION OF P TWENTY ONE RAS FARNESYLATION DOES NOT SUPPRESS MITOGENIC FUNCTIONS IN RAS TRANSFORMED CELLS
HOWEVER IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT A RANGE OF NON RAS PROTEINS ARE TARGETS FOR PRENYLATION
HOWEVER IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW THE PKA OF ARG  EIGHTY TWO IN BR COULD BE MADE SUFFICIENTLY LOW IN ITS M INTERMEDIATE TO SERVE AS THE H RELEASE GROUP AT PH VALUES DOWN TO 
HOWEVER KCAT KM FOR DAMP INCORPORATION WAS ONLY THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN FOR DGMP AND TWENTY SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN FOR DTMP AND DCMP
HOWEVER LIGHT REDUCED FUSION OF WILD TYPE STRAINS TEN TO FIFTEEN FOLD
HOWEVER NO CHROMOSOME ABERRATION WAS SEEN AT THIS STAGE USING FISH ANALYSIS WITH ALL HUMAN CENTROMERES PROBES
HOWEVER NO M INTERMEDIATE FORMATION OCCURS BELOW A PH OF NINE FIGURE THREE INSTEAD THE O INTERMEDIATE PREDOMINATES
HOWEVER ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF PHOTOCLEAVABLE DNA 'BUILDING BLOCS' HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
HOWEVER ONLY SELF REPORTED INFORMATION ON X RAY EXPOSURES AND FAMILY HISTORY OF DISEASE WAS AVAILABLE
HOWEVER OVEREXPRESSION OF A MATING TYPE SPECIFIC HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN IN A HAPLOID STRAIN OF THE OPPOSITE MATING TYPE CONFERS A SELF FILAMENTOUS MORPHOLOGY
HOWEVER PHOSPHO P FIFTY THREE INDUCTION WAS SLIGHTLY FASTER IN RESPONSE TO IR THAN UV AND ITS RESPONSE TO UV PERSISTED LONGER THAN THAT FROM IR EXPOSURE
HOWEVER PRIMER EXTENSION IN THE PRESENCE OF DCTP ONLY LED TO SMALL AMOUNTS OF REACTION PRODUCT
HOWEVER PRIOR STUDIES HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF CHRONIC RB LOSS RATHER THAN THE ACUTE INACTIVATION EVIDENT IN CANCER
HOWEVER RECOMBINANT BWC ONE OR FRAGMENTS OF BWC ONE EXPRESSED IN E COLI CELLS WERE EITHER PRODUCED IN LOW QUANTITIES OR WERE LARGELY INSOLUBLE UNPUBLISHED DATA AND THUS FORMAL DEMONSTRATION OF PHOTORECEPTOR FUNCTION FOR BWC ONE REMAINS TO BE ESTABLISHED
HOWEVER SENSITIVITY TO RADIATION ASSOCIATED MAMMARY DUCTAL DYSPLASIA A PRECURSOR FOR TUMORS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN MICE HETEROZYGOUS FOR AT MUTATIONS
HOWEVER THE AUTHORS NOTED NO MAMMARY CARCINOMA IN ANY OF THE FOUR GENOTYPES STUDIED P FIFTY THREE PLUS PLUS ATM P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM P FIFTY THREE ATM AND P FIFTY THREE ATM
HOWEVER THE CONTRIBUTION OF N OR K RAS ACTIVATION TO INTRINSIC RADIORESISTANCE IN HUMAN CELLS HAS RECENTLY BEEN ADRESSED DIRECTLY I E WITHOUT THE PERTURBATIONS INTRODUCED BY CELL TRANSFORMATION
HOWEVER THE DIRECTION THAT LAMBDAMAX FOR PR WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT UPON SOLUBILIZATION IN OG IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PATTERN FOR BR WHOSE LAMBDAMAX DECREASES WHEN IT IS SOLUBILIZED IN OG
HOWEVER THE EFFECT OF ATTAINED AGE ON RADIATION RELATED BREAST CANCER RISK IS DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE FROM THAT OF AGE AT EXPOSURE EVEN IN A POPULATION SUCH AS THE ATOMIC BOMB SURVIVORS FOR WHICH EXPOSURE WAS TO A GENERAL POPULATION OF ALL AGES AND FOLLOW UP HAS BEEN OF LONG DURATION
HOWEVER THE EVIDENCE GATHERED IN THIS WORK INDICATES THAT THE FOUR DIFFERENT TRANSCRIPTS GENERATED OFF THE SINGLE SUBUNIT A GENE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIALLY REGULATED IN RESPONSE TO SALT CHILLING OR ETIOLATION IN AXENICALLY GROWN SEEDLINGS
HOWEVER THE KCAT KM VALUE WAS ONLY TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN OBSERVED FOR INCORPORATION OPPOSITE THE THREE OTHER BASES THAT IN ADDITION SHOWED QUITE REMARKABLY COMPARABLE VALUES
HOWEVER THE MAGNITUDE OF RISK PER UNIT DOSE DEPENDS STRONGLY ON WHEN RADIATION EXPOSURE OCCURS EXPOSURE BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY YEARS CARRIES THE GREATEST RISK

IN SPITE OF THIS THE QUEST FOR SPECIFIC FTASE TARGETING DRUGS THAT WOULD NOT AFFECT GGTASE IS STILL PERTINENT BECAUSE GERANYLGERANYLATION OF NORMAL CELLULAR PROTEINS IS FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE PREVALENT THAN FARNESYLATION
IN SUMMARY BWC ONE FUNCTION IS CONSERVED IN TWO DIVERGENT CRYPTOCOCCAL VARIETIES AND DATA DERIVED FROM EXPERIMENTS ON LABORATORY STRAINS ARE ALSO OF SIGNIFICANCE TO CLINICAL ISOLATES
IN SUMMARY REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS SEEM TO BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE RISK OF RADIATION RELATED BREAST CANCER WITH SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE FOR A REDUCED RISK AMONG MULTIPAROUS WOMEN OR WOMEN WHO HAD AN EARLY FFTP OR VERY EARLY MENOPAUSE
IN SUMMARY THE DATA PRESENTED INDICATE THAT RB PARTICIPATES IN THE RESPONSE TO UV AND IR DAMAGE SIGNALING IN A DIFFERENTIAL MANNER
IN SUMMARY WE HAVE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE FROM HUMAN STUDIES TO SUPPORT THE ASSERTION THAT FEMALES EXPOSED BEFORE AGE TEN YEARS ARE AT HIGH RISK OF RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER AND THUS THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS BESIDE PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE BREAST AT THE TIME OF EXPOSURE THAT DETERMINE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO RADIATION ASSOCIATED MALIGNANCIES
IN SUMMATION NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION OF THE FOUR SUBUNIT A TRANSCRIPTS WAS DETECTED IN SEEDLINGS IN RESPONSE TO THE THREE STRESS CONDITIONS EVALUATED
IN SUPPORT OF THIS ARGUMENT WE SHOWED THAT THE YIELD FOR THE FORMATION OF G MC IS APPARENTLY LOWER WHILE THE ODN SOLUTION IS SATURATED WITH MOLECULAR OXYGEN BEFORE GAMMA IRRADIATION TABLE ONE
IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS ONE SV OF MIXED RADIATION IS ASSUMED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO ONE GY OF GAMMA RAYS OR X RAYS
IN TERMS OF TISSUE DEVELOPMENT THE NORMAL BREAST IS DIFFERENT FROM MANY OTHER ORGANS IN THAT IT IS NOT FULLY DIFFERENTIATED IN NEWBORNS DESPITE RAPID PROLIFERATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN UTERO
IN THAT CASE CELLS WERE PLATED PRIOR TO TREATMENT AND THE DATA CORRECTED FOR CHANGES IN CELL MULTIPLICITY SEE MATERIALS AND METHODS WHERE NECESSARY

IN THE PRESENT PAPER WE REPORT ON THE BASE PAIRING PROPERTIES OF D  SEVEN NI IN OLIGONUCLEOTIDE DUPLEXES AND COMPARE IT TO THE FIVE NITROINDOLE ISOMER
IN THE PRESENT REPORT WE EXAMINE ITS POTENTIAL USE AS UNIVERSAL DNA NUCLEOSIDE BY ANALOGY WITH THE FIVE NITROINDOLE ANALOG THAT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS UNIVERSAL BASE
IN THE PRESENT STUDY AN EXTREMELY HIGH INCIDENCE OF TUMOURS MOST OF WHICH WERE MAMMARY CARCINOMAS AND THYMIC LYMPHOMAS WAS OBSERVED IN IRRADIATED P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM MICE
IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY OF THE ATM GENE ON MAMMARY TUMOURIGENESIS AFTER X IRRADIATION IN P FIFTY THREE PLUS MICE OF THE BALB CHEA X MSM MS BACKGROUND
IN THE SEQUENCE CONTEXT EXAMINED WE OBSERVED THAT DAMP WAS PREFERENTIALLY INSERTED OPPOSITE BOTH SEVEN NI AND FIVE NI WITH RATES VARYING BY A FACTOR CLOSE TO TEN
IN THE USA IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND WOMEN WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND THAT FORTY THOUSAND WILL DIE FROM THE DISEASE
IN THIS MODEL C NEOFORMANS BWC ONE BWC TWO BIND TO DNA IN THE DARK AND ACT AS WEAK REPRESSORS TO REDUCE FILAMENT DEVELOPMENT
IN THIS MUTANT ASP  EIGHTY FIVE WAS DETECTED BY LOW TEMPERATURE INFRARED DIFFERENCE SPECTROSCOPY TO BE DEPROTONATED ONLY IN THE N INTERMEDIATE AND NOT IN M IT IS NOT CLEAR YET WHETHER ASP  EIGHTY FIVE DEPROTONATION IN AN N LIKE STATE COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE PROTON RELEASE KINETICS OF PR FIG FIVE OR WHETHER THE M INTERMEDIATE ITSELF MIGHT HAVE A PARTIALLY DEPROTONATED ASP  EIGHTY FIVE
IN THIS REGARD HYDROXYL RADICAL IS THE MAJOR ROS FORMED FROM FENTON REACTION OR GAMMA RADIOLYSIS OF WATER
IN THIS RESPECT IT IS VERY EXCITING TO NOTE THAT TWO FARNESYLTRANSFERASE INHIBITORS FTI  TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX AND L  SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HAVE RECENTLY PROVEN TO ACT SYNERGISTICALLY WITH IONIZING RADIATION IN VIVO FOR GROWTH INHIBITION OF XENOTRANSPLANTED H RAS MUTATED HUMAN TUMOR CELLS WITHOUT INCREASE IN ACUTE OR LONG TERM RADIATION INDUCED DAMAGE TO HEALTHY TISSUES
IN THIS RESPECT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE AUTHENTIC G MC LESION IN BOTH DINUCLEOSIDE MONOPHOSPHATE AND ODNS FACILITATES THESE STUDIES
IN THIS RESPECT THE FORMATION OF CROSS LINK LESIONS IS MUCH MORE FACILE AT FIVE PURINE PYRIMIDINE  THREE SITE THAN AT FIVE PYRIMIDINE PURINE  THREE SITE WHICH IS ATTRIBUTED TO THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE RELEVANT CARBON ATOMS INVOLVED IN COUPLING THE TWO NUCLEOBASES IS SHORTER AT THE FORMER SITE THAN AT THE LATTER SITE

ISOLATION OF DNA PCR AMPLIFICATION ELECTROPHORESIS OF PCR PRODUCTS AND ASSESSMENT OF ALLELIC LOSSES WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO A PROCEDURE DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY
IT CAN THUS BE CONCLUDED THAT AS FAR AS HYBRIDIZATION PROPERTIES ARE CONCERNED THE SEVEN NI BASE EXHIBITS BEHAVIOR COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE FIVE ISOMER ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A TRUE UNIVERSAL BASE ACCORDING TO THIS CRITERION
IT CAN THUS BE CONSIDERED AS A CLEAVABLE BASE ANALOG ALTHOUGH NOT FULFILLING STRICTLY ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR A 'UNIVERSAL' BASE ANALOG
IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT SCH  SIXTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX INDUCES DIRUPTION OF MICROTUBULE BINDING TO THE CENTROMERIC PROTEINS CENP E AND CENP F THUS EVOKING AGAIN FAULTY MITOSIS AS AN IMPORTANT OUTCOME OF FTI EXPOSURE
IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE LINEAR DOSE RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP FOR RELATIVELY LOW RADIATION DOSES AS FOUND FOR BREAST CANCER REFLECTS THE LINEAR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RADIATION DOSE AND DSBS
IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT INCREASED BREAST CANCER RISK IN A FEW SUBGROUPS OF THAT COHORT SEEMED TO BE RELATED TO UNUSUALLY LOW RISK IN THE CONTROL GROUP
IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT MULTIGENE FAMILIES MIGHT BE ENCODING FUNCTIONALLY DISTINCT ISOFORMS OF V ATPASE SUBUNITS
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT RB FUNCTION IS IMPAIRED IN THE MAJORITY OF CANCERS AS THE ACTIVITIES OF SEVERAL DISPARATE MECHANISMS RESULT IN ITS FUNCTIONAL INACTIVATION
IT IS ALSO FORMALLY POSSIBLE THAT LIGHT CAUSES BWC ONE BWC TWO TO INCREASE TRANSCRIPTION OF A GENE THAT FUNCTIONS TO REPRESS MATING AND OR REPRESSES TRANSCRIPTION OF A REPRESSOR OF UV SENSITIVITY
IT IS ANTICIPATED FROM THE STRICT ADDITIVITY OF RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE AND RADIATION THAT NEITHER INDUCED RADIATION RESISTANCE NOR ACUTE OR LATE COMPLICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY SHOULD OCCUR IN COMBINED TREATMENT WITH RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE
IT IS CHALLENGING TO STUDY THE COMBINED ROLE OF GENES AND RADIATION IN THE ETIOLOGY OF BREAST CANCER IN HUMANS BECAUSE ONE NEEDS A LARGE POPULATION EXPOSED TO A RANGE OF RADIATION DOSES TO ENSURE STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT SUCH A GENE RADIATION INTERACTION ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF RADIATION DOSE TO THE BREAST AVAILABILITY OF BLOOD SAMPLES OR OTHER BIOSPECIMEN TYPES TO PERFORM GENOTYPING ON EXTRACTED DNA AND AN APPROPRIATE COMPARISON GROUP
IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THE MOLECULAR OXYGEN IS PARTIALLY CONSUMED DURING THE GAMMA IRRADIATION PROCESS
IT IS THEREFORE LIKELY THAT BWC ONE BWC TWO CONTROL MATING BY INFLUENCING THE TEMPORAL REGULATION OF THESE GENES
IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO CONCLUDE THAT EITHER THE H RELEASE GROUPS IN PR AND BR ARE NON HOMOLOGOUS SURFACE CARBOXYLIC ACID RESIDUES AS SUGGESTED PREVIOUSLY OR ELSE THAT A CONSERVED NON CARBOXYLIC ACID RESIDUE I E ARG EIGHTY TWO OVER NINETY FOUR OR ASP EIGHTY FIVE OVER NINETY SEVEN IS THE H RELEASE GROUP IN PR
IT IS THOUGHT THAT PREGNANCIES AND FFTP IN PARTICULAR CONSECUTIVELY DECREASE THE POOL OF VULNERABLE BREAST CELLS
IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT HYDROXYL RADICAL CAN REACT WITH THYMINE AND FIVE METHYLCYTOSINE BY EITHER ADDING TO THE C FIVE EQUAL TO C SIX DOUBLE BOND OR ABSTRACTING A HYDROGEN ATOM FROM THE METHYL GROUP
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF THE METHYL GROUP RADICAL I CANNOT BE GENERATED ON AN UNMETHYLATED CYTOSINE UNDERSCORING THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF CYTOSINE METHYLATION IN INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESION FORMATION AND HIGH MUTATION FREQUENCY OBSERVED AT CPG SITES
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT UNDER THIS ENZYMIC DIGESTION CONDITION THE PHOSPHODIESTER BOND ON THE THREE SIDE OF THE G MC CROSS LINK APPEARS TO BE COMPLETELY CLEAVED VIDE INFRA
IT SHOULD BE CAUTIONED THAT EXTERNAL STANDARDS WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE ABOVE QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS AND MORE ACCURATE RESULTS FOR THE ABSOLUTE YIELDS SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY LC MS MS METHOD WITH ISOTOPE LABELED INTERNAL STANDARDS
IT SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND THAT 'FAMILY HISTORY' IS ONLY A VERY CRUDE MEASURE OF POSSIBLE GENETIC EFFECTS IN THAT IT REPRESENTS A MIXTURE OF BACKGROUND RISK OF BREAST CANCER WHICH IS HIGH IN WESTERN COUNTRIES SHARED ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES GENETIC FACTORS AND COMBINATIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND GENETIC FACTORS
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE EIGHTEEN MER PRIMER ANNEALED TO TEMPLATE IN WHICH N TWENTY WAS A GUANINE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY CONVERTED IN THE CONDITIONS USED
IT THUS APPEARS THAT CHANGING A SINGLE DOWNSTREAM TEMPLATE BASE DOES NOT MODIFY NUCLEOTIDE INCORPORATION OPPOSITE THE UNNATURAL SEVEN NI BASE

IT WAS FIRST DESIGNED AS A PRECURSOR TO PREPARE DNA FRAGMENTS CONTAINING THE HIGHLY LABILE DEOXYRIBONOLACTONE LESION
IT WAS FOUND THAT AN INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESION IN WHICH THE METHYL CARBON ATOM OF FIVE METHYLCYTOSINE AND THE C EIGHT CARBON ATOM OF GUANINE ARE COVALENTLY BONDED COULD BE FORMED FROM THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED RADICAL AT BOTH GMC AND MCG SITES WITH THE YIELD BEING MUCH HIGHER AT THE FORMER SITE
IT WAS THEN LOADED ON A TEN CM X ONE CM HYDROXYLAPATITE BIOGEL HTP BIORAD COLUMN AND ELUTED UNDER PRESSURE WITH A ZERO  SIX HUNDRED MM PHOSPHATE GRADIENT TWO HUNDRED ML TOTAL VOLUME FLOW RATE ZERO POINT FIVE ML MIN

THE EXACT REASON FOR THIS IS NOT CLEAR
THE EXCISED DILUTED BAND WAS RE AMPLIFIED TO ENSURE FIDELITY OF THE PCR
THE FACT THAT EXTENSION OF THE PRIMER TERMINATED BY SEVEN NI IS POSSIBLE WHEN OPPOSED TO THYMINE SUGGESTS RECOGNITION OF SEVEN NI BY KF EXO AS AN ADENINE
THE FACULTATIVE CAM PLANT MESEMBRYANTHEMUM CRYSTALLINUM DISPLAYS A DIFFERENTIAL ORGAN LEVEL RESPONSE TO SALT STRESS WHILE STILL ENGAGED IN C THREE PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THE FAILURE IN CLEAVAGES OF THE PHOSPHODIESTER BONDS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THAT THE BULKY PHOTOPRODUCT OR THYMINE GLYCOL CANNOT BE FIT INTO THE ACTIVE SITE OF NUCLEASE P ONE

THE HYDROGEN ABSTRACTION FROM THE METHYL GROUP WHICH GIVES RISE TO THE METHYL RADICAL OF THE PYRIMIDINE BASES SCHEME ONE I ACCOUNTS FOR TEN PERCENT OF THE SECONDARY RADICAL PRODUCTS OF THE PYRIMIDINE BASES FORMED FROM GAMMA IRRADIATION
THE IDENTITIES OF THESE TWO PRODUCTS REMAIN UNCLEAR THOUGH ESI MS MS RESULTS INDICATE THAT THEY MIGHT BE INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESIONS WHERE THE MC IS COVALENTLY LINKED TO GUANINE AT A DISTAL SITE ESI MS AND MS MS RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES S SIX AND S SEVEN
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS FOR MODIFICATION OF DOSE SPECIFIC BREAST CANCER RISK BY FRACTIONATION AND PROTRACTION OF DOSE ARE UNCLEAR AND THE RESULTS COULD REFLECT EFFECTS OF YET UNRECOGNIZED CONFOUNDING FACTORS
THE INCIDENCE OF MAMMARY CARCINOMA FOR EACH GENOTYPE WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN IRRADIATED AND NON IRRADIATED GROUPS
THE INCIDENCE OF MAMMARY CARCINOMAS IN P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM MICE APPEARED TO BE HIGHER THAN THAT IN P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM MICE BUT THE INCIDENCES DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN ATM AND ATM GENOTYPES P EQUAL TO ZERO POINT THREE TWO BY FISHER'S EXACT PROBABILITY TEST
THE INCIDENCE OF THE LYMPHOMAS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG THE FOUR GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT GENOTYPES FOR P FIFTY THREE AND ATM GENES
THE INDEPENDENT GENERATION OF REACTIVE INTERMEDIATES OF NUCLEOSIDES ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM THEIR PHOTOLABILE PRECURSORS FACILITATES THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ROLES OF THESE REACTIVE INTERMEDIATES IN DNA DAMAGE
THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED RADICAL ALLOWS FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF PURE SUFFICIENT AND WELL CHARACTERIZED INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESION BEARING ODN SUBSTRATES FOR FUTURE BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS
THE INDUCTION OF UV PROTECTING CAROTENOIDS IN N CRASSA BY LIGHT IN A WC  ONE DEPENDENT MANNER SUPPORTS THIS HYPOTHESIS
THE INFLUX OF WATER AND METABOLITES INTO THE VACUOLE IS DEPENDENT IN PART ON THE GENERATION OF A PROTON MOTIVE FORCE ACROSS THE TONOPLAST
THE INITIAL PURITY LEVEL OF THE OG SOLUBILIZED CHOLATE EXTRACTED MEMBRANE IS ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT PR BY WEIGHT
THE INITIAL VELOCITIES WERE MEASURED AND PLOTTED VERSUS DNTP AND FITTED TO THE MICHAELIS MENTEN EQUATION TO DETERMINE THE KM AND KCAT CONSTANTS

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HETEROZYGOUS ATM KNOCKOUT ALLELES INTO THE BACKGROUND OF THE P FIFTY THREE PLUS GENOTYPE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE INCIDENCE OF MAMMARY CARCINOMA TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT THIRTY TWO OUT OF FIFTY FIVE AND INCREASED THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF MAMMARY CARCINOMAS PER MOUSE
THE K RAS PROTEIN CAN ALTERNATIVELY BE PRENYLATED BY TYPE I GERANYLGERANYLTRANSFERASE GGTASE I A CLOSELY RELATED ENZYME
THE KCAT KM VALUE FOR DAMP INCORPORATION WAS RESPECTIVELY ELEVEN TIMES THIRTEEN TIMES AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN MEASURED FOR DGMP DTMP AND DCMP INCORPORATION

THE LACK OF PROTEIN SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SERIES OF FTIS AS NON RAS FARNESYLATED PROTEINS MAY PARTICIPATE IN TRANSFORMATION BY RAS DEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENT PATHWAYS
THE LATTER AS WELL AS ARG  EIGHTY TWO HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN FAST PROTON RELEASE
THE LATTER BAND A SINGLET IS COINCIDENTALLY AT ALMOST THE SAME APPARENT MW AS THE DOUBLET FROM THE UNCLEAVED POST TRANSLATIONALLY MODIFIED WILD TYPE PR FIG TWO LANE E
THE LATTER MIGHT BE DUE TO THE HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF THE TRANSCRIPT OR DUE TO MORE EFFICIENT AMPLIFICATION OF THE TRANSCRIPT  THREE PRIMER SET
THE LATTER RADICAL CAN ALSO BE INDUCED FROM TYPE I PHOTO OXIDATION PROCESS
THE LATTER SEEMS UNLIKELY DUE TO THE DHPC MOLECULE BEING ZWITTERIONIC AT PH NINE POINT FIVE WITH NO PROTON ON THE TRIMETHYL MODIFIED NITROGEN OF THE CHOLINE
THE LC MS MS RESULT SHOWS THAT UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS THE FORMATION OF THE G MC CROSS LINK LESION FROM THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED I IS LESS EFFICIENT IN DOUBLE THAN IN SINGLE STRANDED ODNS
THE LC MS MS RESULTS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT THE G MC CROSS LINK LESION CAN BE INDUCED FROM THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED RADICAL IN A DUPLEX ENVIRONMENT
THE LC MS MS RESULTS SHOWED THAT AMONG THE EIGHT POTENTIAL DIGESTION PRODUCTS THAT WE MONITORED D G MC ONE SCHEME THREE M Z FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE IS THE MAJOR PRODUCT RESULTING FROM THE DIGESTION WITH ALL FOUR ENZYMES
THE LESSER DEGREE OF INCREASE FOR TRANSCRIPT  THREE MIGHT BE DUE TO NEAR SATURATION OF THE SIGNAL
THE LEVELS OF TRANSCRIPT PARTICULARLY OF BWC ONE WERE VERY LOW AND THEREFORE SAMPLES WERE ENRICHED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FOLD BY PURIFYING MRNA FROM TOTAL RNA FOR NORTHERN BLOT ANALYSIS
THE LIKELY SPECTRAL OVERLAP BETWEEN PR AND ITS OWN POSTULATED N PHOTOPRODUCT COMPLICATES THE DETERMINATION OF AMOUNTS OF EACH THAT ARE PRESENT
THE LIMITED WORK DONE TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF V ATPASES IN DROUGHT STRESS HAS PROVIDED CONFLICTING RESULTS
THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THESE TWO PHENOMENA IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE OBSERVATION THAT NEITHER A TRANSIENT FOUR HUNDRED NM ABSORBANCE INCREASE NOR FAST H RELEASE IS SHOWN TO OCCUR AT PH EIGHT AND BELOW
THE LOW FREQUENCY OF ALL AFOREMENTIONED MUTATIONS IN THE POPULATION MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO STUDY RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER RISK AMONG CARRIERS AND SO FAR NO EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA ARE AVAILABLE
THE LOWER YIELD FOR THE FORMATION OF THE CROSS LINK LESION UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS IS NOT SURPRISING AGAIN BECAUSE THE METHYL RADICAL OF FIVE METHYLCYTOSINE CAN ALSO COUPLE WITH MOLECULAR OXYGEN TO FORM A PEROXYL RADICAL SCHEME TWO II
THE M INTERMEDIATE OF BR HAS AN UNPROTONATED SCHIFF BASE GROUP GIVING RISE TO A BLUE SHIFTED LAMBDAMAX FOUR HUNDRED NM

THE MATING PHENOTYPE OF BWC ONE MUTANTS SUGGESTED THAT BWC ONE BWC TWO REGULATES GENE EXPRESSION DURING MATING
THE MATING TYPE LOCI OF BASIDIOMYCETES HAVE BEEN WELL STUDIED AND COMPRISE TWO DISTINCT GENE SETS THOSE THAT ENCODE PHEROMONES AND THOSE THAT ENCODE HOMEODOMAIN PROTEINS BOTH OF WHICH CONTROL DIFFERENT STEPS IN MATING
THE MATING TYPE SPECIFIC HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN SXI ONE ALPHA OF C NEOFORMANS IS IMPORTANT FOR EVENTS AFTER CELL FUSION
THE MEAN  STANDARD DEVIATION LATENCY PERIODS WERE THIRTY TWO POINT SIX PLUS MINUS FOUR POINT EIGHT AND TWENTY NINE POINT EIGHT PLUS MINUS THREE POINT SIX WEEKS IN P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM AND P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM MICE RESPECTIVELY
THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN RAS RELATED RADIORESISTANCE ARE STILL OPEN TO QUESTION BUT IT MIGHT REASONABLY BE PROPOSED THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION OF PATHWAYS DOWSTREAM FROM RAS IN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION SUCH AS RAF  ONE OR PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL THREE KINASE
THE MEMBRANE WAS BLOCKED IN TEN PERCENT MILK OVER ONE X SALINE TWEEN AND PROBED WITH EITHER ONE  ONE THOUSAND PRIMARY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SPECIFIC FOR CPD OR SIX  FOUR PP DNA LESIONS T MATSUNAGA
THE MEMBRANE WAS SATURATED WITH BOVINE SERUM ALBUMINE AND INCUBATED WITH A MOUSE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY DIRECTED AGAINST LAMIN B PROTEIN DETECTION WAS CARRIED OUT USING A PEROXIDASE CONJUGATED GOAT ANTI MOUSE SECONDARY ANTIBODY AND AN ECL KIT AMERSHAM PHARMACIA BIOTECH ORSAY FRANCE
THE METHYL RADICAL FORMED FROM THOSE OXIDATION PROCESSES MAY REACT WITH THE NEIGHBORING NUCLEOBASE TO FORM INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESIONS SCHEME ONE
THE METHYLATED CPGS ARE MUTATIONAL HOTSPOTS IN P FIFTY THREE TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE AND THE MOST COMMON MUTATIONS ARE MC T TRANSITIONS
THE MICE WERE EXPOSED TO X RAYS FIVE GY ZERO POINT FIVE GY MIN AT AGE FIVE WEEKS
THE MITOTIC INDEX DECREASED DURING TREATMENT DATA NOT SHOWN THUS CONFIRMING THAT THE ACCUMULATION OF HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN CELLS WAS IN THE G TWO PHASE
THE MIXTURE WAS INCUBATED AT THIRTY SEVEN C FOR TWELVE H AND AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR ANOTHER TWELVE H
THE MIXTURE WAS STIRRED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE OVERNIGHT

THE MURINE EXPERIMENT PROTOCOL WAS APPROVED BY THE DUKE UNIVERSITY ANIMAL USE COMMITTEE
THE MUTANT SEROTYPE D STRAINS WERE CROSSED TO THE CONGENIC STRAIN JEC TWENTY MATA TO OBTAIN STRAINS WITH THE OPPOSITE MATING TYPE
THE MUTATIONS HAD NO EFFECT ON PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED FOR VIRULENCE IN MAMMALIAN HOSTS SUCH AS THE PRODUCTION OF THE PIGMENT MELANIN OR THE POLYSACCHARIDE CAPSULE OR GROWTH AT THIRTY SEVEN C UNPUBLISHED DATA
THE N CRASSA COMPLEX ALSO REGULATES TRANSCRIPTION OF FRQ AND THE FRQ PROTEIN FEEDBACK INHIBITS THE COMPLEX THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE WIRING OF THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK
THE N CRASSA MODEL IS SIMILAR BUT DIFFERS IN SEVERAL KEY FEATURES
THE N O TRANSITION INVOLVES THE REPROTONATION OF THE ASP  NINETY SIX FROM THE CYTOPLASMIC SPACE
THE NECESSITY OF RECONSTITUTING PR WITH SOME LIPID BEFORE IT IS CAPABLE OF PHOTOCYCLING SHOWS THAT THE PRESENCE OF LIPIDS FACILITATES PR IN ASSUMING ITS FULLY ACTIVE STRUCTURE
THE NEGATIVE SIGNAL IS INDICATIVE OF A PH DECREASE CORRESPONDING TO TRANSIENT H RELEASE FROM THE PROTEIN INTO THE SOLUTION
THE NITROINDOLE NUCLEOSIDE PHOSPHORAMIDITE D  SEVEN NI WAS PREPARED AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
THE OCCURRENCE OF EARLY ONSET BREAST CANCER IS ANOTHER SURROGATE MEASURE FOR POSSIBLE GENETIC AND OTHER FACTORS
THE ODN SOLUTION WAS THEN IRRADIATED FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCEDURES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE SINGLE STRANDED ODN
THE OG EXTRACT OF CHOLATE WASHED MEMBRANE PELLETS STARTS OUT AT A PR CONTENT OF SEVEN PERCENT TOTAL PROTEIN W W
THE ONLY WAY THAT THE H RELEASE MECHANISM CAN BE STRONGLY CONSERVED BETWEEN BR AND PR IS IF ARGININE ITSELF SERVES AS THE PRINCIPAL DONOR GROUP FOR FAST H RELEASE IN BOTH WITH NEARBY RESIDUES SUCH AS E ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR AND E TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR MERELY MODULATING THE PKA OF THE ARGININE IN THE M INTERMEDIATE
THE ONLY WORK PUBLISHED PREVIOUSLY ON V ATPASE SUBUNIT ISOFORMS AND STRESS IS CONCERNED WITH THE PROTEOLIPID GENE FAMILY IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA

THE OTHER TWO HPLC FRACTIONS TWENTY POINT NINE AND TWENTY ONE POINT EIGHT MIN FIGURE ONE B HAVE THE SAME MOLECULAR WEIGHT AS THE CROSS LINK LESION CONTAINING ODN DISCUSSED ABOVE TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MIN FRACTION
THE OUTCOME APPEARS TO DEPEND VERY MUCH ON THE CELL LINE AND THE SPECIFICITY OF THE FTI USED
THE OVERALL YIELD OF PR FROM MEMBRANE THROUGH THE COLUMN PURIFICATIONS IS THIRTY PERCENT
THE P FIFTY THREE HETEROZYGOTES OF BALB C GENETIC BACKGROUND DEVELOP MAMMARY TUMOURS
THE P FIFTY THREE HETEROZYGOUS DEFICIENT BALB C MICE WHICH DEVELOPED MAMMARY CARCINOMAS EARLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAY REPRESENT A USEFUL MODEL FOR THE STUDY OF EFFECTS OF GENES OTHER THAN ATM ON MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS

THE POOLED SUPERNATANTS CONTAINING OG SOLUBILIZED PR FIFTEEN MG WERE THEN DILUTED SIX X WITH BUFFER A
THE POSITIVE FOUR HUNDRED NM TRACE IN FIG FIVE REPRODUCED FROM FIG THREE SHOWS THAT THE PROTON RELEASE AND UPTAKE FOLLOW KINETICS VERY SIMILAR TO THE APPARENT FORMATION AND DECAY OF M AS IS TYPICALLY SEEN IN BR NEAR NEUTRAL PH HOWEVER NO PROTON RELEASE SIGNAL COULD BE OBSERVED FOR PR AT PH SIX OR EIGHT DATA NOT SHOWN
THE POSTULATED ROLE OF HORMONES IN MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS WAS CORROBORATED BY STUDIES SHOWING DOSE DEPENDENT INCREASING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING LEVELS OF ENDOGENOUS SEX HORMONE LEVELS IN BLOOD
THE PR CONTAINED IN THE BACTERIAL MEMBRANES WAS SHOWN TO ACT AS A LIGHT ACTIVATED PROTON PUMP BUT ONLY WHEN RETINAL IS PRESENT
THE PR ELUTED AT AN OG CONCENTRATION OF ONE POINT FIVE
THE PREDICTED BWC ONE PROTEIN LACKS A DNA BINDING DOMAIN FOUND IN THE ASCOMYCETE WC  ONE HOMOLOGS
THE PREDICTED BWC ONE PROTEIN SHARES IDENTITY WITH NEUROSPORA CRASSA WC  ONE BUT LACKS THE ZINC FINGER DNA BINDING DOMAIN
THE PREDICTED WC  ONE HOMOLOG CONTAINS A LOV DOMAIN TWO ADDITIONAL PAS DOMAINS AND A NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION SIGNAL
THE PRESENCE OF FAST H RELEASE IN PR INDICATES THAT EITHER DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FAST H RELEASE IN PR AND BR I E THAT THE H RELEASE GROUP IS NOT HIGHLY CONSERVED OR THAT THE H RELEASE GROUP IS CONSERVED AND IS THEREFORE LIKELY ARG  NINETY FOUR ITSELF IN PR AND ARG  EIGHTY TWO IN BR CORRESPONDINGLY
THE PRESENCE OF REGULATORY ELEMENTS IN THE THREE END OF THE SUBUNIT A GENE COULD BE A POTENTIAL MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS PROTEIN IS POST TRANSCRIPTIONALLY REGULATED
THE PRESENT WORK SHOWS THAT SEVEN NI PRESENTS SOME OF THE BIOPHYSICAL AND ENZYMATIC RECOGNITION PROPERTIES REQUIRED FOR A UNIVERSAL BASE ANALOG AS IT SHARES MANY COMMON FEATURES WITH ITS FIVE NITROINDOLE ISOMER
THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE POLY A TAIL IS THOUGHT TO BE IN MESSAGE STABILITY ASSISTED BY A SERIES OF POLY A BINDING PROTEINS
THE PRIMARY NUCLEOTIDE AND AMINO ACID SEQUENCE OF THE A THALIANA SUBUNIT A CDNA SHOWED A HIGH DEGREE OF IDENTITY WITH SUBUNIT A CDNA SEQUENCED FROM OTHER ORGANISMS
THE PRIMER PAIRS WERE DESIGNED SUCH THAT THE FOUR AMPLIFICATION PRODUCTS WOULD DIFFER IN SIZE BY APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED BASE PAIRS FOR EASE OF VISUALIZATION ON AGAROSE GELS AND BLOTS FIG FIVE AND FIG SIX
THE PRIMER TEMPLATES USED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE DESIGNED IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF CHANGING THE TEMPLATE BASE AT THE FIVE SIDE OF D  SEVEN NI ON THE INITIATION OF THE EXTENSION OF THE PRIMER
THE PRIMERS ELONGATED BY ONE SEVEN NI BASE WERE PREPARED AS DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT FIGURE NINE LANES TWO SIX TEN AND FOURTEEN
THE PRINCIPAL MECHANISMS FOR REPAIR OF DSBS IN MAMMALIAN CELLS ARE HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION AND NON HOMOLOGOUS END JOINING NHEJ
THE PROBE UTILIZED WAS A THREE HUNDRED BASE PAIR DIGOXIGENIN LABELED PCR PRODUCT
THE PROCESSED TUMOUR SPECIMENS WERE EVALUATED BY MEDICAL AND VETERINARY PATHOLOGISTS USING THE ANNAPOLIS GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY CARDIFF AND COWORKERS
THE PRODUCTION OF TWO COMPLEMENTARY PAIRS OF IONS I E A FIVE G W SEVEN PLUS G  TWO AND FIGURE TWO A DEMONSTRATES THAT THE GUANINE AT THE FIFTH POSITION IS COVALENTLY LINKED WITH FIVE METHYLCYTOSINE AT THE SIXTH POSITION BECAUSE A SIX AND W SEVEN PLUS G IONS CAN ONLY BE PRODUCED WHEN THE TWO NUCLEOBASES ARE CROSS LINKED FIGURE TWO B
THE PROPORTION OF MICE DEVELOPING MAMMARY CARCINOMAS IN THE P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THAT IN THE P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM GROUP P EQUAL TO ZERO POINT ZERO ZERO THREE FOUR BY CHI TWO TEST
THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF EARLY AGE AT FIRST BIRTH HELD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE PAROUS AT THE TIME OF EXPOSURE AND FOR WOMEN WHO COMPLETED A FIRST PREGNANCY AFTER RADIATION EXPOSURE SUGGESTING THAT AN EARLY FIRST PREGNANCY MAY PROTECT AGAINST THE CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS OF RADIATION EXPOSURE ON THE BREAST REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE EXPOSURE OCCURRED BEFORE OR AFTER THE PREGNANCY
THE PROTEINS COULD HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AT OTHER TIMES OF GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED UV IRRADIATION DUE TO ATMOSPHERIC AND VEGETATION CHANGES SUCH AS AT THE END OF THE PERMIAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MYA OR CRETACEOUS SIXTY FIVE MYA WHEN THERE ARE SPIKES OF FUNGI IN THE FOSSIL RECORD
THE PROTEINS SHARE A SIMILAR STRUCTURE WITH REGARD TO THE PAS DOMAINS AND ALL OF THE ASCOMYCETE WC  ONE GENES EXAMINED CONTAINED A ZINC FINGER DNA BINDING DOMAIN WHEREAS NONE OF THE BASIDIOMYCETE WC  ONE HOMOLOGS ENCODE PRODUCTS WITH THIS DOMAIN
THE PURIFIED ODNS WERE FURTHER DESALTED BY HPLC BEFORE UV C IRRADIATION
THE QUESTION COULD NOT BE EVALUATED IN ATOMIC BOMB SURVIVORS BECAUSE OF SUSPECTED POOR KNOWLEDGE AND OR REPORTING OF THIS INFORMATION
THE RADICAL PRECURSOR CONTAINING DUPLEX ODNS WERE FORMED BY ANNEALING THE TWO COMPLEMENTARY STRANDS IN A BUFFER CONTAINING FIFTY MM NACL AND TEN MM PHOSPHATE PH SEVEN AND THE ANNEALING WAS CARRIED OUT BY HEATING TO NINETY C AND COOLING SLOWLY TO ROOM TEMPERATURE
THE RADICAL PRECURSOR CONTAINING PHOSPHORAMIDITE WAS SYNTHESIZED AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY
THE RATIONALE FOR THESE TREATMENTS RELIES MOSTLY ON THE DRUGS' ABILITY TO STERILIZE DISSEMINATED METASTASES SPATIAL COOPERATION AND ON RADIATION DRUG INTERACTION FOR IMPROVED LOCAL CONTROL OF THE PRIMARY TUMOR
THE RB E TWO F COMPLEX FORMS ON THE PROMOTERS OF A MULTITUDE OF E TWO F TARGET GENES TO REPRESS TRANSCRIPTION

THE REACTIONS WERE QUENCHED BY ADDING TWENTY MUL FORMAMIDE DYE MIXTURE AND HEATING AT SEVENTY C FOR FIVE MIN
THE REASON FOR THE REQUIREMENT OF DHPC IN M INTERMEDIATE FORMATION AND FAST PROTON RELEASE IS UNCLEAR
THE REQUIREMENT FOR PR TO BE IN LIPID TO SHOW FAST H RELEASE AND M FORMATION STEMS EITHER FROM A PROTEIN LIPID INTERACTION NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A STABLE ACTIVE TERTIARY STRUCTURE OR FROM THE NEED FOR THE PHOSPHATE GROUP IN DHPC TO ACT AS A PROTON RELEASE GROUP
THE RESPECTIVE MC G CROSS LINK LESION IS FORMED WITH A YIELD THAT IS GREATER THAN TEN FOLD LOWER THAN THE G MC LESION UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
THE RESPONSE OF HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN A  FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE AND MIAPACA  TWO CELLS TO RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE WAS INVESTIGATED THROUGH GROWTH INHIBITION ASSAYS WITH EXPONENTIALLY GROWING SUBCULTURES

THE RESULTING SOLUTION WAS DISPERSED IN A PYREX TUBE AND DEGASSED BY THREE CYCLES OF FREEZE PUMP THAW
THE RESULTING SOLUTION WAS DRIED BY THE SPEED VAC DESALTED AND DIGESTED WITH ENZYMES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE UV IRRADIATION MIXTURE
THE RESULTING SOLUTION WAS IRRADIATED WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR NM ULTRAVIOLET UV LIGHT FROM A TLC LAMP UVP INC UPLAND CA AT ROOM TEMPERATURE FOR TWENTY MIN THE PERCENT TRANSMITTANCE OF LIGHT AT THIS WAVELENGTH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE TWENTY FIVE  FORTY PERCENT DRIED IN A SPEED VAC REDISSOLVED IN WATER AND SEPARATED BY HPLC
THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BRDU INCORPORATION COMPARED WITH UNTREATED CONTROLS SET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN RB PROFICIENT MAFS TWENTY FOUR H FOLLOWING DAMAGE SUGGESTING THAT THE DOSES OF IR USED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE REPAIRABLE FIGURE FOUR A
THE RESULTS FIGURE EIGHT UNAMBIGUOUSLY SHOW COMPLETE ABSENCE OF LAMIN B CLEAVAGE
THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT INDICATE THAT ALL FOUR TRANSCRIPTS BEHAVED IDENTICALLY WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL STRESS CONDITIONS FIG SEVEN
THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPERIMENT INDICATED THAT ALL FOUR PRIMER PAIRS AMPLIFIED ONLY A SINGLE BAND OF THE APPROPRIATE AND EXPECTED SIZE AND THAT THE TRANSCRIPT  FOUR PROBE ADEQUATELY HYBRIDIZED TO ALL FOUR AMPLIFICATION PRODUCTS FIG FIVE
THE RESULTS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER HOWEVER DEMONSTRATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE PHENYLTHIOLATE BEARING NUCLEOSIDE CAN FACILITATE THE GENERATION OF PURE SUFFICIENT AND WELL CHARACTERIZED LESION CONTAINING ODN SUBSTRATES THAT CAN BE READILY USED FOR EXAMINING THE THERMODYNAMIC REPLICATION AND REPAIR STUDIES OF THE G MC LESION
THE RETINOBLASTOMA TUMOR SUPPRESSOR RB IS FUNCTIONALLY INACTIVATED IN THE MAJORITY OF CANCERS AND IS A CRITICAL MEDIATOR OF DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINTS
THE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION REACTION MIXTURE INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS IN A TOTAL VOLUME OF TWENTY MUL
THE RISK ALSO CAN BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF EXCESS ABSOLUTE RISK EAR EXPRESSED IN INCIDENT CASES PER ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR WOMAN YEAR SV OR THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF BREAST CANCERS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RADIATION EXPOSURE OF ONE SV AMONG TEN THOUSAND RADIATION EXPOSED WOMEN
THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER AFTER RADIATION EXPOSURE AMONG CARRIERS OF MUTATIONS IN THE BRCA ONE AND BRCA TWO GENES ALSO IS UNCLEAR
THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER AFTER RADIATION EXPOSURE IN ATM HETEROZYGOTES IS UNCLEAR AND HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO FIERCE DEBATE
THE ROCHESTER POST PARTUM MASTITIS STUDY SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF DEVIATION FROM THE ADDITIVE INTERACTION MODEL FOR AGE AT FFTP AND RADIATION DOSE THE ROLE OF PARITY IN ITSELF COULD NOT BE EVALUATED BECAUSE ALL WOMEN WERE PAROUS AND LACTATING BY DEFINITION
THE ROLES FOR WC  ONE AND WC  TWO IN N CRASSA PHOTOPERCEPTION ALSO CHANGE DURING THE DAY ADDING TO THE CHALLENGE OF ELUCIDATING THEIR FUNCTIONS
THE ROLES OF THE C NEOFORMANS BWC ONE AND BWC TWO GENES IN VIRULENCE WERE EXAMINED
THE SAME EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED WITH THE TEMPLATE CONTAINING FIVE NI INDICATED THAT DAMP WAS INCORPORATED OPPOSITE THE UNNATURAL BASE FIGURE FIVE LANE FIVE
THE SAME EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED WITH THE TEMPLATE CONTAINING D  FIVE NI SEQUENCE ELEVEN ALSO SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR DAMP INCORPORATION OPPOSITE THE MODIFIED BASE AND THE INCORPORATION FREQUENCY OPPOSITE D  FIVE NI FOLLOWED THE SAME ORDER AS DETERMINED FOR D  SEVEN NI
THE SAMPLE WAS HEATED AT NINETY C FOR FIVE MINUTES AND CHILLED ON ICE
THE SAMPLE WAS INCUBATED AT FORTY TWO C FOR ONE HOUR FOLLOWED BY HEAT DENATURATION OF THE ENZYME AT NINETY FIVE C FOR TEN MINUTES
THE SCHIFF BASE READILY UNDERGOES DEPROTONATION IN THE M INTERMEDIATE
THE SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL SUBUNIT A GENES WAS CONDUCTED USING WHOLE GENOME BLOT ANALYSIS SCREENING A LAMBDA PRL  TWO CDNA LIBRARY INTRON LENGTH POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS AND EXTENSIVE COMPUTER SEARCHES OF THE ARABIDOPSIS EXPRESSED SEQUENCE TAG DATABASE GENBANK AND THE ARABIDOPSIS GENOME INITIATIVE
THE SECOND ISOLATE TWENTY EIGHT H THREE BEARS AN INSERTION IN THE PROMOTER OF THE RUM ONE A GENE WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE MATING TYPE LOCUS OF C NEOFORMANS
THE SECOND PHASE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED NM ABSORBANCE DECAY OCCURS WITH A SUBSTANTIALLY SLOWER TIME CONSTANT OF ZERO POINT FIVE S RETURNING THE REMAINING TWENTY PERCENT OF INITIAL ABSORBANCE CHANGE
THE SECOND STEP OF REACTION CONSISTING IN ADDING ONE MORE MONOPHOSPHATE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE BASE IN FIVE POSITION OF THE D  SEVEN NI IN THE TEMPLATE OR IN FULL LENGTH PRIMER EXTENSION WAS CATALYZED BY KF EXO ZERO POINT ZERO ONE TWO FIVE U MUL IN PRESENCE OF EITHER ONE DNTP FIVE HUNDRED MUM OR THE FOUR DNTPS FIVE HUNDRED MUM EACH IN A FINAL VOLUME OF TWENTY MUL
THE SELF FILAMENTOUS MATA PLUSSXI ONE ALPHA HAPLOID STRAIN WAS MUTATED WITH TRANSFER DNA T DNA CONTAINING A NOURSEOTHRICIN RESISTANCE CASSETTE USING THE TRANS KINGDOM DNA DELIVERY VEHICLE AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS
THE SELF FILAMENTOUS SEROTYPE D STRAIN WAS OBTAINED BY INTRODUCING THE SXI ONE ALPHA GENE ADJACENT TO URA FIVE INTO STRAIN JEC THIRTY FOUR MATA URA FIVE
THE SELF FILAMENTOUS STRAIN WAS MUTATED WITH T DNA INSERTIONS FROM AGROBACTERIUM AND THREE MUTANT C NEOFORMANS STRAINS WITH EQUIVALENT FILAMENT FORMATION IN THE LIGHT AND THE DARK AND UV HYPERSENSITIVITY WERE ISOLATED
THE SEPARATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY USING A ZERO POINT FIVE X ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MM ZORBAX SB C EIGHTEEN COLUMN WITH A PARTICLE SIZE OF FIVE MUM AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES AND AN AGILENT ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CAPILLARY HPLC PUMP WAS EMPLOYED
THE SEQUENCE SELECTIVE FORMATION OF THE CROSS LINK LESIONS CAN AGAIN BE EXPLAINED FROM THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE METHYL CARBON ATOM OF MC AND THE C EIGHT CARBON OF ITS NEIGHBORING GUANINE IS SHORTER IN GMC SEQUENCE THAN IN MCG SEQUENCE
THE SEROTYPE A BWC ONE STRAINS WERE ALSO FOUND TO BE HYPERSENSITIVE TO UV LIGHT UNPUBLISHED DATA
THE SEROTYPE A BWC ONE URA FIVE STRAIN WAS CROSSED TO STRAIN KN NINETY NINE ALPHA TO OBTAIN A MATALPHA BWC ONE STRAIN
THE SEVEN NITROINDOLE NUCLEOSIDE TRIPHOSPHATE ONE WAS PREPARED USING THE LUDWIG ECKSTEIN METHOD WHICH ALLOWS ONE POT TRIPHOSPHATE FORMATION STARTING FROM THREE PROTECTED NUCLEOSIDES SEE FIGURE FOUR
THE SHORT TERM INCREASED RISK FOR BREAST CANCER WAS HIGHEST FOR WOMEN DELIVERING A FIRST CHILD AT OLDER AGES WHO MIGHT HAVE ACCUMULATED MORE PREMALIGNANT CONDITIONS THAN YOUNGER WOMEN
THE SIEVERT SV IS A WEIGHTED SUM OF DOSES DOSE EQUIVALENT USED FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF RADIATION SUCH AS THE MIXED GAMMA AND NEUTRON RADIATION FROM THE ATOMIC BOMBINGS
THE SIGMOIDAL CURVES ALPHA EQUAL TO F T OBTAINED FROM THE STANDARD UV MELTING CURVES FOR THE DIFFERENT DUPLEXES EXHIBITED MELTING COOPERATIVITY AND WERE ANALYZED TO DERIVE THE TM VALUES AND THE VAN'T HOFF TRANSITION ENTHALPY DELTAH ENTROPY DELTAS AND FREE ENERGY DELTAG
THE SINGLE A THALIANA SUBUNIT A GENE WAS SHOWN BY WHOLE RNA BLOT ANALYSIS TO BE TRANSCRIBED IN ALL ORGANS OF THE PLANT TESTED
THE SINGLE GENE IDENTIFIED WAS SHOWN BY WHOLE RNA BLOT ANALYSIS TO BE TRANSCRIBED IN ALL ORGANS OF THE PLANT
THE SINGLE VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASE SUBUNIT A GENE DETECTED IN A THALIANA CAN PRODUCE AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT LENGTH TRANSCRIPTS BY USING DIFFERENT POLYADENYLATION SITES
THE SINGLY HETEROZYGOUS P FIFTY THREE PLUS MICE SUBJECTED TO X IRRADIATION DEVELOPED MAMMARY CARCINOMAS AT AROUND TWENTY FIVE WEEKS OF AGE AND THE FINAL INCIDENCE OF MAMMARY CARCINOMAS AT THIRTY NINE WEEKS WAS THIRTY ONE PERCENT NINETEEN OUT OF SIXTY ONE
THE SIZE OF THE NUCLEI AND THE NUMBER OF GIANT CELLS GREW IN PARALLEL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE DRUG UP TO THREEFOLD RELATIVE TO CONTROLS
THE SLOW FIVE HUNDRED MS DECAY OBSERVED IN BOTH THE FOUR HUNDRED NM AND FIVE HUNDRED NM TIME COURSES INDICATES AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE M AND N INTERMEDIATES THAT REMAINS UNTIL PR RETURNS TO ITS INITIAL RESTING STATE
THE SLOWEST DECAY COMPONENTS OF THE POSITIVE FOUR HUNDRED NM SIGNAL AND THE NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED NM SIGNAL FOLLOW SIMILAR KINETICS ALTHOUGH THE AMPLITUDES OF THESE COMPONENTS DIFFER BY A FACTOR OF THREE
THE SMALL SIZE OF THE A THALIANA GENOME MAY BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND TOWARD STREAMLINING OF DNA IN THIS PLANT WHICH MAY HAVE ELIMINATED A REDUNDANT SUBUNIT A GENE OVER EVOLUTIONARY TIME
THE SOLUTION WAS DRIED IN A SPEED VAC THERMO SAVANT INC HOLBROOK NY AND SUBJECTED TO HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY HPLC PURIFICATION
THE SOLUTION WAS STIRRED FOR ONE H AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
THE SOLVENTS WERE REMOVED UNDER REDUCED PRESSURE
THE SPRAY VOLTAGES WERE FOUR AND THREE POINT FOUR KV FOR EXPERIMENTS IN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ION MODES RESPECTIVELY
THE STEADY STATE KINETIC CONSTANTS FOR SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE INCORPORATION ARE REPORTED IN TABLE THREE
THE STRAIN GREW AS A BUDDING YEAST AT THIRTY SEVEN C AND FILAMENTED AT TWENTY FIVE C AND LIKE MATA MATALPHA DIPLOIDS FILAMENTATION WAS INHIBITED BY LIGHT AND WAS MOST ROBUST ON V EIGHT MATING MEDIUM FIGURE FIVE A
THE STRESS FIBERS AND THE TUBULIN NETWORK WERE NORMAL IN THESE CELLS FIGURE SIX B SIX D
THE STRONG DEPENDENCE ON AGE AS SEEN FOR MANY OTHER ADULT TYPE CANCERS IS PROBABLY RELATED TO ACCUMULATING GENETIC DAMAGE THAT OCCURS DURING A HUMAN LIFESPAN
THE SUBUNIT A PROTEIN IS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY KDA IN MOST ORGANISMS STUDIED AND IS A HYDROPHILIC PEPTIDE LOCATED IN THE HEAD GROUP OF THE V ONE PERIPHERAL SECTOR IN THREE COPIES PER HOLOENZYME
THE SXI ONE ALPHA GENE WHICH ENCODES THE MATALPHA SPECIFIC HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE GENOME OF A MATA HAPLOID STRAIN
THE THERMODYNAMICS OF MELTING WERE DETERMINED WITH THE BASE PAIRS AS INDICATED IN THE BOXED REGION FIGURE THREE
THE THIRD ISOLATE TWENTY FIVE F EIGHT CONTAINS AN INSERTION IN THE PROMOTER OF A GENE DESIGNATED BWC TWO FOR A CONSISTENT NOMENCLATURE WITH RESPECT TO BWC ONE GENBANK AY EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT WHICH ENCODES A PREDICTED PROTEIN WITH A PAS AND A ZINC FINGER DNA BINDING DOMAIN FIGURE FIVE B
THE THREE ACETYL NUCLEOSIDE TWO FIFTY MG ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MUMOL WAS DEHYDRATED BY COEVAPORATION WITH DRY PYRIDINE TWICE AND THEN DISSOLVED UNDER ARGON IN DRY PYRIDINE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MUL AND DRY DIOXANE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MUL
THE THREE CELL LINES WERE NOT EQUALLY RESPONSIVE TO DRUG FIGURE THREE
THE THREE PUTATIVE PHOTORECEPTOR GENES WERE MUTATED IN A C NEOFORMANS VAR
THE TIME COURSES IN FIGS
THE TIME RESOLVED MEASUREMENTS SHOWED NO POSITIVE FOUR HUNDRED NM ABSORBANCE SIGNALS AT PH EIGHT OR LOWER FIG THREE
THE TRANSCRIPT  FOUR AMPLIFICATION PRODUCT WHICH IS THE SMALLEST AND NESTED WITHIN THE OTHER THREE ACTED AS PROBE TO DETECT ALL FOUR TRANSCRIPTS
THE TRANSCRIPT FOUR AMPLIFICATION PRODUCT WAS PURIFIED VIA LOW MELTING POINT AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND USED AS TEMPLATE FOR PROBE GENERATION
THE TRANSCRIPT FOUR AMPLIFICATION PRODUCT WAS USED AS TEMPLATE FOR THE GENERATION OF A DIGOXIGENIN LABELED PROBE FOR USE IN THE SUBUNIT A TRANSCRIPT STRESS RESPONSE EXPERIMENT
THE TRIPHOSPHATE ONE WAS OBTAINED WITH TWENTY PERCENT OVERALL YIELD AND CHARACTERIZED BY ONE H AND THIRTY ONE P NMR AND BY ES MS SPECTROMETRY
THE TRIPHOSPHATE WAS INSERTED OPPOSITE EACH NATURAL BASE WITH AT LEAST THE SAME EFFICIENCY AS DAMP OPPOSITE THYMINE
THE TRIPLE CYSTEINE MUTANT PR TCM HAS ALL THREE OF ITS NATIVE CYSTEINES CYS  ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN CYS  ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX AND CYS  ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE REPLACED WITH SERINES AND WAS PREPARED USING THE SAME E COLI EXPRESSION SYSTEM AND PURIFICATION METHODS AS THE WILD TYPE
THE TUBE WITH THE ODN SOLUTION WAS THEN FILLED WITH HIGH PURITY ARGON AND EXPOSED TO A MARK I ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CS IRRADIATOR JL SHEPHERD AND ASSOCIATES SAN FERNANDO CA AT A DOSE RATE OF TWO GY MIN FOR THREE H TOTAL DOSE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY GY
THE TWO BASES HAVE COMPARABLE BEHAVIOR ALTHOUGH SEVEN NI SHOWS MORE DISCRIMINATION THAN FIVE NI
THE TWO NITROINDOLE BASES HAVE COMPARABLE BEHAVIOR EXHIBITING SLIGHT DISCRIMINATION THE SEVEN NI BASE BEING SLIGHTLY MORE DISCRIMINATING
THE TWO PROTEINS PHYSICALLY INTERACT THROUGH PAS CONSERVED IN PER ARNT SIM PROTEINS DOMAINS
THE TWO TRANSCRIPTS ARE DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED IN RESPONSE TO SUGARS
THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS FOR THIS CHANGE COULD BE MULTIPLE
THE UNNATURAL SELF PAIR SEVEN NI  SEVEN NI CONTAINING DUPLEX WAS ALSO EXAMINED SEQUENCE ONE SEQUENCE NINE
THE UPSTREAM PRIMER WAS LOCATED IN THE CODING REGION OF THE SUBUNIT A CDNA
THE UV PROTECTING ABILITY OF THE WC  ONE PROTEINS IS A LIKELY SELECTIVE FORCE THAT HAS SERVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENCE IN FUNGI TO THIS DAY
THE V ZERO INTEGRAL SECTOR IS EMBEDDED IN THE MEMBRANE AND CONSISTS OF AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT SUBUNITS
THE VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASE IN PLANTS IS A LARGE MULTIMERIC ENZYME COMPLEX WHOSE FUNCTION IS TO PUMP PROTONS ACROSS A MEMBRANE VIA PRIMARY ACTIVE TRANSPORT
THE VARIABLE 'FAMILY HISTORY OF BREAST AND OR OVARIAN CANCER' DID NOT ACT AS AN EFFECT MODIFIER IN THE MASTITIS SERIES
THE VARIATION MAY BE DUE IN PART TO DIFFERENCES IN SEVERAL FACTORS THAT CAN MODIFY THE RADIATION RELATED RISK OR DOSE RESPONSE AS DISCUSSED BELOW
THE WC  ONE PROTEIN FUNCTIONS AS THE BLUE LIGHT RECEPTOR THROUGH A SPECIALIZED PAS DOMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR SENSING LIGHT OXYGEN AND VOLTAGE IN OTHER PROTEINS LOV DOMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH WC  TWO ACTS AS A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR
THE WC  ONE PROTEIN INTERACTS WITH A FLAVIN CHROMOPHORE FLAVIN ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE FAD TO FUNCTION AS THE BLUE LIGHT RECEPTOR
THE WILD TYPE ALLELES OF THE P FIFTY THREE AND ATM GENES WERE EXAMINED IN MAMMARY CARCINOMA TISSUE FROM HETEROZYGOUS MICE
THE WILD TYPE AND THE TARGETED ALLELES OF THE P FIFTY THREE GENE WERE AMPLIFIED BY PCR USING PRIMERS P FIFTY THREE  FOUR F FIVE CGACCTCCGTTCTCTCTCCTCTCTT  THREE AND P FIFTY THREE  SIX R FIVE AGACGCACAAACCAAAACAAAATTACA  THREE AND PRIMERS P FIFTY THREE NF FIVE GCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACGAGT  THREE AND P FIFTY THREE  SIX R RESPECTIVELY
THE WILD TYPE BWC ONE AND BWC TWO MUTANTS AS WELL AS THE BWC ONE PLUS BWC ONE AND BWC TWO PLUS BWC TWO COMPLEMENTED STRAINS WERE INOCULATED BY INHALATION INTO TEN MICE EACH AND HOST FITNESS AND SURVIVAL WERE EXAMINED DAILY FIGURE EIGHT
THE WILD TYPE P FIFTY THREE ALLELE WAS LOST IN TWENTY FIVE NINETY SIX PERCENT OUT OF TWENTY SIX MAMMARY CARCINOMAS FROM IRRADIATED P FIFTY THREE PLUS MICE AND IN ALL OF FIFTEEN MAMMARY CARCINOMAS FROM NONIRRADIATED P FIFTY THREE PLUS MICE REGARDLESS OF ATM GENE STATUS
THE YIELD IS AGAIN HIGHER UNDER ANAEROBIC THAN UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS
THEN TRIBUTYLAMMONIUM PYROPHOSPHATE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MUL OF ZERO POINT FIVE M SOLUTION IN DRY DMF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MUMOL AND TRIBUTYLAMINE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MUL ZERO POINT EIGHT MMOL WERE ADDED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND STIRRED FOR THIRTY MIN
THEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN INDIVIDUAL MUTANT STRAINS WERE ISOLATED INTO NINETY SIX WELL MICROTITER PLATES AND WERE ANALYZED WITH A STEREOMICROSCOPE TO EXAMINE FILAMENT FORMATION AFTER TWENTY FOUR AND FORTY EIGHT H OF GROWTH IN THE DARK AND LIGHT ON V EIGHT AGAR MEDIUM
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POTENTIAL CANDIDATES
THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL SIX  FOUR PP REPAIR KINETICS AMONG RB PROFICIENT AND DEFICIENT CELLS
THERE IS A CAVEAT IN THESE MODELS IN THAT RB LOSS IS COMPENSATED BY RB RELATED POCKET PROTEINS I E P ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN AND P ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DURING DEVELOPMENT
THERE IS A CLEAR KINETIC CORRELATION BETWEEN M AND OR N INTERMEDIATE FORMATION AND FAST H RELEASE IN PR
THERE IS NO APPARENT DIFFERENCE IN COUPLING EFFICIENCY BETWEEN RADICAL PRECURSOR CONTAINING PHOSPHORAMIDITE BUILDING BLOCK AND CONVENTIONAL PHOSPHORAMIDITES THAT WERE USED IN THE SOLID PHASE SYNTHESIS
THERE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A FURTHER POST TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION OF UNKNOWN NATURE
THERE THEREFORE SEEMS TO BE NO SIMPLE WAY TO DESCRIBE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RADIATION DOSE AND BREAST CANCER INCIDENCE WHICH VARIES CONSIDERABLY FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
THERE WAS ALSO NO REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE IN HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES BETWEEN ATM FIG ONE C ONE D AND ATM MICE FIG ONE E ONE F IN THE IRRADIATED GROUPS
THERE WAS NO EFFECT ON MATING OR FRUITING IN STRAINS WITH THE OPSIN OPS ONE OR PHYTOCHROME PHY ONE MUTATIONS EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION UNPUBLISHED DATA
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR HOMODIMER FORMATION FOR EITHER BWC ONE OR BWC TWO AND NO EFFECTS OF LIGHT ON THE REPORTER GENE DEPENDENT GROWTH OF THE STRAINS WERE OBSERVED
THEREAFTER INCIDENCE STILL INCREASES WITH AGE BUT MORE SLOWLY
THEREFORE AS A CONTROL FOR UPSTREAM SIGNALING IMMUNOBLOTTING FOR TOTAL P FIFTY THREE AND PHOSPHO P FIFTY THREE SER  EIGHTEEN WAS PERFORMED
THEREFORE EVEN IN BR IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT THESE GROUPS THEMSELVES CHANGE PROTONATION STATE BETWEEN BR AND M TO PROVIDE THE H RELEASED TO THE BULK MEDIUM
THEREFORE IT CAN BE ENVISIONED THAT RB LOSS AND DOWNSTREAM TARGET DEREGULATION COULD HAVE DISTINCT EFFECTS UPON THE CELLULAR RESPONSE TO GENOTOXIC INSULT INCLUDING BOTH CHECKPOINT DEREGULATION AND ABERRANT REPAIR
THEREFORE IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALL LIVING PLANT CELLS REQUIRE V ATPASE FUNCTION
THEREFORE IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT A SUBUNIT A GENE WOULD HAVE ESCAPED THE SCREEN BY HAVING A LOW DEGREE OF NUCLEOTIDE IDENTITY
THEREFORE RB DELETION IN PRIMARY ADULT CELLS RESULTS IN TARGET GENE DEREGULATION
THEREFORE THE CLOSELY COUPLED DYNAMICS OF THESE EVENTS SUGGEST THAT RB FUNCTIONAL INACTIVATION COINCIDENT WITH DOWNSTREAM TARGET DEREGULATION IS REQUIRED FOR THE LOSS OF PROPER CELL CYCLE ARREST IN RESPONSE TO DNA DAMAGE
THEREFORE THE FIVE PHENYLTHIOMETHYL GROUP MAY PREDISPOSE THE RADICAL I IN A POSITION THAT IS NOT IDEAL FOR COUPLING WITH THE C EIGHT CARBON ATOM OF THE NEIGHBORING GUANINE
THEREFORE THE G MC LESION WHICH FORMS AT A MUCH HIGHER YIELD THAN THE MC G LESION MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO CPG MUTAGENESIS
THEREFORE THE OBSERVED UV REPAIR FACTOR DYNAMICS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE KINETICS OF SIX  FOUR PP LESION REMOVAL FOR EACH CELL TYPE
THEREFORE THIS KIND OF CROSS LINK LESION MAY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CYTOTOXIC EFFECT OF ROS
THEREFORE TO DISSECT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PCNA INVOLVEMENT IN UV DAMAGE REPAIR CHROMATIN EXTRACTIONS WERE PERFORMED ON AD GFP AND AD GFP CRE INFECTED MAFS AT ZERO THREE AND FIVE H FOLLOWING UV TREATMENT
THEREFORE WE COMPARED THE SDS PAGE GEL MOBILITY OF WILD TYPE PR TO THAT OF A CYS LESS MUTANT PR TCM
THERMAL DENATURATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE TWO UNNATURAL BASES LEAD TO STRONG DECREASE IN DUPLEX STABILITY COMPARABLE TO THAT CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF A MISMATCH
THESE ADAPTIVE DIFFERENCES PRESUMABLY OPTIMIZE THE PROTEINS TO OPERATE AT MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY IN THE NICHES THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE ORGANISMS OCCUPY
THESE APPEAR TO CORRESPOND TO THE PRESENCE OF TWO DISTINCT SUBPOPULATIONS OF PR AT LEAST WHEN EXPRESSED IN E COLI AND SOLUBILIZED IN OG MICELLES
THESE CHEMICAL NUCLEASES INCLUDING NOTABLY METALLIC COMPLEXES OR PHOTOACTIVE DERIVATIVES NECESSITATE ADDITION OF REAGENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY REMOVAL OF BYPRODUCTS
THESE DATA ALTOGETHER SUGGEST THAT INHIBITION OF LAMIN B FARNESYLATION COULD BE AN IMPORTANT TARGET OF RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE RESULTING IN AN ABERRANT ONSET OF MITOSIS AND CYTOKINESIS AND ENSUING HYPERPLOID CELL GENERATION
THESE DATA ARGUE THAT THE RAPID FUNCTION OF RB IN CELL CYCLE ARREST FOLLOWING DNA DAMAGE DOES NOT APPARENTLY INVOLVE ATTENUATION OF TARGET GENES
THESE DATA INDICATE THAT RB IS REQUIRED FOR THE RAPID INDUCTION OF CELL CYCLE ARREST FOLLOWING RECOGNITION OF BOTH UV AND IR DAMAGE IN ADULT PRIMARY CELLS
THESE DATA INDICATE THAT RB LOSS IS SUFFICIENT TO BYPASS THE RAPID CHECKPOINT RESPONSE TO DNA DAMAGE
THESE DATA INDICATE THAT THE RB DEFICIENT CELLS ARE ABLE TO INITIATE UV INDUCED DAMAGE REPAIR WITH ENHANCED KINETICS AND THAT IN THESE CELLS THE PCNA DISTRIBUTION MORE RAPIDLY SHIFTED ITS ASSOCIATION WITH REPAIR FOCI TO REPLICATION FOCI FOLLOWING DAMAGE
THESE DATA LEAD US TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT BWC ONE FUNCTIONS AS A BLUE LIGHT PHOTORECEPTOR AS IS THE CASE FOR N CRASSA WC  ONE
THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT BWC ONE BWC TWO FUNCTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO REPRESS TRANSCRIPTION OF THESE TWO KEY GENES THAT REGULATE MATING AND COMPLETION OF THE SEXUAL CYCLE
THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT N CRASSA WC  ONE MAY ALSO BE A UV RESPONSIVE PROTEIN AND FUNCTION LIKE C NEOFORMANS IN PROTECTING THE FUNGUS FROM UV DAMAGE
THESE ENDEAVORS HAVE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED ON SALT AND COLD STRESS
THESE EXPERIMENTS ALSO REVEALED DIFFERENTIAL PCNA CHROMATIN TETHERING PATTERNS WITHIN THE NUCLEI OF CELLS FOLLOWING UV DAMAGE WHICH INDICATED THAT A SHIFT IN PCNA FUNCTION WAS OCCURRING DURING UV DAMAGE REPAIR FIGURE SIX B
THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT BWC ONE AND BWC TWO CAN PHYSICALLY INTERACT WHEN EXPRESSED IN THE NUCLEUS OF ANOTHER FUNGAL SPECIES AND THAT THEY CAN DO SO IN A LIGHT INDEPENDENT MANNER
THESE FINDINGS WERE LATER REPLICATED IN AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE STUDY OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEMALE HL SURVIVORS INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL DUTCH COHORT
THESE HYPOTHESES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW
THESE ISOFORMS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE UNIQUE FUNCTIONS OR REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS WITHIN THE VARIED MICRO COMPARTMENTS REQUIRING V ATPASES
THESE LESIONS ARE CLEARLY INDUCED IN MAFS BY TEN J M TWO UV AT T EQUAL TO ZERO
THESE MAMMARY CARCINOMAS WERE MAINLY OBSERVED AT FORTY ONE  SEVENTY SEVEN WEEKS AFTER BIRTH FIG TWO
THESE MAMMARY CARCINOMAS WERE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANTLY EARLIER AT EIGHTEEN  THIRTY EIGHT WEEKS AFTER IRRADIATION I E TWENTY THREE  FORTY THREE WEEKS OF AGE THAN IN THE NONIRRADIATED GROUP AGE FORTY ONE  SEVENTY FIVE WEEKS FIG TWO
THESE OBSERVATIONS CORRELATE THOSE MADE BY OTHER AUTHORS USING RAS MUTATED HUMAN PANCREATIC CELLS AND L  SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO OR HUMAN LUNG CANCER CELLS AND FTI  TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE
THESE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT BWC ONE AND BWC TWO CAN INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN VIVO
THESE OLIGOMERS WERE PURIFIED BY ELECTROPHORESIS ON A TWENTY PERCENT POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL IN THE PRESENCE OF SEVEN M UREA
THESE POTENTIAL ARTIFACTS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ANY ATTEMPT TO REPRODUCE THE RESULTS IN FIG
THESE PROCESSES HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS TO MANY ASPECTS OF HUMAN LIFE AS THE UNCONTROLLED PROLIFERATION OF FUNGI CAN LEAD TO DEVASTATING PLANT DISEASE MOLD AND HUMAN DISEASE
THESE RESEARCHERS INDICATED THAT ARABIDOPSIS ALSO WAS A COLD TOLERANT PLANT WHICH EXHIBITED A SIMILAR RESPONSE WITH RESPECT TO V ATPASE SUBUNIT A MRNA HOWEVER THEY PROVIDED NO DATA
THESE RESULTS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE WHOLE RNA STRESS BLOT ANALYSIS
THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT A ROLE FOR BLUE UV LIGHT IN CONTROLLING DEVELOPMENT IS AN ANCIENT PROCESS THAT PREDATES THE DIVERGENCE OF THE FUNGI INTO THE ASCOMYCETE AND BASIDIOMYCETE PHYLA
THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT BWC ONE FUNCTIONS IN LIGHT RESPONSES AT BOTH THE INITIAL CELL FUSION STEP AND DURING SUBSEQUENT FILAMENT FORMATION
THESE RESULTS INDICATE A POTENTIAL ROLE FOR THE VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASE IN MAINTENANCE OF HOMEOSTASIS DURING TIMES OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS
THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT D  SEVEN NI IS RECOGNIZED BY KF EXO MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN D  FIVE NI
THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE HOMOZYGOUS LOSS OF THE P FIFTY THREE ALLELE WAS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAMMARY CARCINOMAS WHEREAS THE ATM NULL ALLELE EXHIBITED HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY
THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE NOTION OF A SINGLE SUBUNIT A GENE IN A THALIANA THAT IS TRANSCRIBED IN ALL CELLS OF THE PLANT
THESE TRANSCRIPTS DIFFER ONLY IN THEIR THREE UNTRANSLATED REGION AND PRODUCE IDENTICAL PROTEINS
THESE TUMOURS FORMED GLANDS LINED BY HIGHLY PLEOMORPHIC CELLS EXHIBITING FREQUENT MITOSIS AND WERE CLASSIFIED AS GLANDULAR ADENOCARCINOMAS HIGH GRADE ACCORDING TO THE ANNAPOLIS PATHOLOGY CLASSIFICATION
THESE TURN OUT TO BE SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED FOR BR IN THE PH RANGE FIVE POINT FIVE
THESE TWO GENES ENCODE PROTEINS WITH SEVERAL CONSERVED DOMAINS INCLUDING A ZINC FINGER DNA BINDING DOMAIN FOUND IN BOTH PROTEINS
THESE TWO RESIDUES ALONG WITH ARG  EIGHTY TWO HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN LIGHT ACTIVATED FAST H RELEASE TO THE EXTRACELLULAR MEDIUM IN BR IT IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN THAT PR CARRIES OUT ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY USING A MECHANISM THAT IS COMPLETELY HOMOLOGOUS TO THAT OF BR
THIRTEEN C NMR SEVENTY FIVE MHZ CDCL THREE DELTA EQUAL TO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT SIX ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN POINT THREE TWO C ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX POINT SIX ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT THREE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN POINT FIVE ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR POINT SIX EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR POINT FOUR SEVENTY FOUR POINT TWO SIXTY TWO POINT SIX THIRTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN 
THIRTY FOUR ARE AN AVERAGE OF FORTY CYCLES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CRESOL RED EXPERIMENTS AVERAGING ONE HUNDRED CYCLES FIG FIVE BOTTOM TRACE
THIRTY ONE P NMR ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MHZ D TWO O OVER TEN MM EDTA PH EQUAL TO EIGHT DELTA EQUAL TO TWENTY ONE POINT SIX NINE
THIS APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY FINDING MAY BE THE RESULT OF PHYSICAL CHANGES IN THE ENZYME ITSELF OR CHANGES IN THE LIPID ENVIRONMENT
THIS APPROACH OFFERS A DISTINCTIVE ADVANTAGE OVER THE USE OF IONIZING RADIATION FENTON REACTION OR OTHER OXIDATIVE DNA DAMAGE AGENTS IN WHICH MULTIPLE REACTIVE INTERMEDIATES ARE FORMED
THIS ASSUMPTION IS ACTUALLY EXPECTED TO UNDERESTIMATE THE PURITY OF PR PRODUCED BY UP TO TWENTY PERCENT SINCE THE PR WE EXPRESSED HAS TEN TRYPTOPHAN AND FOURTEEN TYROSINE RESIDUES AS COMPARED TO EIGHT TRYPTOPHANS AND ELEVEN TYROSINES IN BR FROM H SALINARUM
THIS CDNA ENCODED A PUTATIVE OPEN READING FRAME CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF OTHER SUBUNIT A GENES AND WAS SHOWN TO HAVE ALL THE MOTIFS COMMON TO SUBUNIT A
THIS CHOLATE WASHED MEMBRANE PELLET WAS THEN FURTHER EXTRACTED THREE X WITH THREE PERCENT BETA OCTYL D GLUCOSIDE OG IN BUFFER A THIRTY MIN WITH STIRRING FOUR C
THIS COLUMN PROVED TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AS A FINAL STEP IN THE PURIFICATION THAN AS A PRELIMINARY ONE BECAUSE LARGE AMOUNTS OF CONTAMINANT PROTEIN TENDED TO SLOW THE FLOW RATE DRASTICALLY
THIS COMPOUND COULD THUS POSSESS THE TWO COMPLEMENTARY PROPERTIES OF BEING UNIVERSAL AND PHOTOCLEAVABLE AN APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN ELEGANTLY PIONEERED BY PIRRUNG IN DEVELOPING THE DNA BASE ANALOG NITROPIPERONYL TWO DEOXYRIBOSIDE
THIS CONCEPT OF HORMONAL CARCINOGENESIS IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH EPIDEMIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS THAT LATE MENARCHE AND EARLY MENOPAUSE HAVE A PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST BREAST CANCER
THIS CULTURE WAS THEN DILUTED TEN X INTO SEVERAL FIVE HUNDRED ML CULTURES
THIS CULTURE WAS THEN INCUBATED FOR FOUR H THIRTY SEVEN C THREE HUNDRED RPM
THIS DATA A PRIORI SUPPORTS THE FIRST MODEL WHEREIN RB ACTS DIRECTLY TO INHIBIT REPLICATION AND ARREST CELL CYCLE FOLLOWING RECOGNITION OF DNA DAMAGE
THIS DOUBLET IS ALSO PRESENT IN THE LESS PURIFIED SAMPLE OF PR TCM WITH BOTH BANDS SHIFTED DOWN BY APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT FIG TWO LANE C
THIS DUAL EFFECT PHENOMENON NAMELY THE SHORT TERM INCREASING BUT LONG TERM REDUCING EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY ON BREAST CANCER RISK HAS BEEN SHOWN NOT ONLY FOR A FIRST PREGNANCY BUT ALSO FOR SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCIES
THIS EFFECT WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE STRONG MODIFICATION OF THE DOSE RESPONSE BY EXPOSURE AGE
THIS ELONGATION WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE OF THE BASE DOWNSTREAM TO THYMINE IN THE TEMPLATE
THIS FACT IMPLIES A POSSIBLE ROLE FOR THESE ISOFORMS IN ALLOWING THE PLANT TO DEAL WITH STRESS
THIS FINDING IS SUPPORTED BY RESULTS FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL RAT MODEL SYSTEM FOR RADIATION ASSOCIATED MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS
THIS GENE WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED IN AN INDEPENDENT INSERTION MUTANT WITH A DIFFERENT PHENOTYPE AND WAS THEREFORE NOT ANALYZED FURTHER
THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN CLEARLY IN EARLY RODENT STUDIES WHERE CHEMICAL ASSOCIATED OR RADIATION ASSOCIATED MAMMARY TUMORS WERE MOST ABUNDANT AFTER ADDITIONAL HORMONAL STIMULATION
THIS HIGH DEGREE OF CONSERVATION WAS EVIDENT ACROSS TAXA AS DIVERSE AS ANIMALS PLANTS FUNGI AND PROTOZOA
THIS INFORMATION CAN THEN BE USED TO CALCULATE THE RISK OF RADIATION ASSOCIATED CANCER AT A CERTAIN AGE OR TO ADJUST FOR ATTAINED AGE IN THE COHORT
THIS IS BASED ON OBSERVATIONS THAT MALIGNANT TUMORS USUALLY ARISE FROM UNDIFFERENTIATED STRUCTURES WHEREAS BENIGN LESIONS ARISE MOSTLY FROM MORE DIFFERENTIATED PARTS OF THE MAMMARY GLAND
THIS IS IN AGREEMENT WITH RESULTS ON BR FOR WHICH O FORMATION IS ALSO ENHANCED AT LOWER PH VALUES AND BECOMES SMALL OR NEARLY UNOBSERVABLE IN THE ALKALINE RANGE
THIS IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT SEEDLINGS ARE THE MOST RAPIDLY GROWING AND METABOLIZING STAGE OF THE PLANT TESTED
THIS IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM LAMBDAMAX FOR THE RESTING STATE OF PR FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX NM
THIS IS OF CONCERN FOR EXAMPLE TO FARNESYL TRANSFERASE INHIBITORS FTIS OF WHICH SIX HAVE ALREADY BEEN TESTED IN PHASE
THIS IS REPRESENTED BY THE PRESENCE OF PEAKS IN THE SICS FOR THE M Z EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN AND M Z EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE TRANSITIONS BOTH PATHWAYS CORRESPOND TO THE LOSS OF A FIVE METHYLCYTOSINE SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE S THIRTEEN THE IDENTITIES OF COMPOUNDS FIVE AND SIX ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PRODUCT ION SPECTRA OF THE IONS OF M Z EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE S FOURTEEN
THIS IS SOMEWHAT IN DISAGREEMENT WITH BEJA ET AL WHO DETECTED SMALL FOUR HUNDRED NM TRANSIENT ABSORBANCE INCREASES UPON PHOTOLYSIS AT PH 
THIS IS THE FIRST EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT RB INACTIVATION MODIFIES DNA DAMAGE REPAIR
THIS LIPID DOES NOT SUPPORT THE FORMATION OF CLOSED BILAYER VESICLES BUT RATHER FORMS MICELLES LIKE A DETERGENT
THIS MAY BE A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM AVOIDING POSSIBLE MISREPAIR
THIS MAY SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE DNA DOUBLE STRAND BREAK REPAIR PATHWAY ARE UPSTREAM OF THE RB E TWO F AXIS OR THAT THOSE REPAIR FACTORS DEREGULATED VIA RB LOSS ARE NOT RATE LIMITING FOR REPAIR
THIS MODEL SYSTEM ENABLED US TO INVESTIGATE THE TEMPORAL ROLE OF RB LOSS ON CELL CYCLE CHECKPOINTS AND DNA DAMAGE REPAIR FOLLOWING ULTRAVIOLET UV AND IONIZING RADIATION IR DAMAGE
THIS MOTIF IS CLEAVED UPON POST TRANSLATIONAL MATURATION OF LAMIN A BUT PERSISTS IN LAMIN B UNLESS THE C TERMINAL AMINOACID RESIDUE IS MUTATED
THIS NESTING WAS ACCOMPLISHED TO AVOID DIFFERENCES IN SIGNAL DURING HYBRIDIZATION BASED ON DIFFERENT PROBE LENGTHS AND LABELING EFFICIENCY
THIS OBSERVATION IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES FOR CROSS LINK LESIONS FORMED BETWEEN THE C FIVE CARBON ATOM OF CYTOSINE AND THE C EIGHT CARBON ATOM OF THE NEIGHBORING GUANINE OR BETWEEN THE METHYL CARBON ATOM OF THYMINE AND THE C EIGHT CARBON ATOM OF THE VICINAL PURINE BASES
THIS OBSERVATION IS IN DRASTIC CONTRAST WITH THE FORMATION OF CROSS LINK LESION FROM THE PYREX FILTERED UV LIGHT IRRADIATION OF FIVE BROMOCYTOSINE CONTAINING DUPLEX ODN IN WHICH THE FORMATION OF CROSS LINK LESION IN DOUBLE STRANDED DNA IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT
THIS OBSERVATION MIGHT BE PARTLY RELATED TO HEIGHTENED RADIOSENSITIVITY IN YOUNG WOMEN WITH BBD BUT MIGHT ALSO BE DUE TO THE UNDERLYING ASSOCIATION OF BBD AND BREAST CANCER
THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTS THAT DURING MATING ONLY ONE CELL INDEPENDENT OF MATING TYPE NEEDS TO COMMIT TO FUSION
THIS OCCURRED WITHOUT LAMIN B BREAKDOWN FIGURE EIGHT CONSISTENT WITH LACK OF A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF APOPTOSIS IN THE THREE CELL LINES USED
THIS OCCURS IN SPITE OF SIGNIFICANT HYPERPLOIDIZATION ACCUMULATION OF CELLS IN G TWO AND DEPLETION OF S PHASE
THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON IONIZING RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER IN THE CONTEXT OF ESTABLISHED BREAST CANCER RISK FACTORS THE RADIATION DOSE RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP AND MODIFIERS OF DOSE RESPONSE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES AND ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS
THIS PHOTOACTIVE SEVEN NITROINDOLE HETEROCYCLE IS INDEED AN ANALOG OF THE FOUR FIVE AND SIX NITROINDOLES WHICH HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AS 'UNIVERSAL' BASES IN OLIGONUCLEOTIDES AMONG WHICH THE AUTHORS CONCLUDED THAT THE FIVE NITRO ISOMER WAS SUPERIOR GIVING HIGHEST DUPLEX STABILITY AND BEHAVING INDISCRIMINATELY TOWARDS EACH OF THE FOUR NATURAL BASES IN DUPLEX MELTING EXPERIMENTS
THIS POSITIVE ABSORBANCE DIFFERENCE IS INDICATIVE OF O INTERMEDIATE FORMATION
THIS PROBE WAS USED FOR MULTI ORGAN RNA BLOT ANALYSIS AND STRESS RESPONSE NORTHERNS
THIS PROBE WAS USED FOR WHOLE GENOME BLOT ANALYSIS
THIS PROMPTED US TO INVESTIGATE THE CELLS' RESPONSE TO RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE SCHEME ONE A NON PEPTIDOMIMETIC FTI ISSUED FROM CHEMICAL OPTIMIZATION FROM SERIES SELECTED BY RANDOM SCREENING AT RHONE POULENC RORER CO BOTH ALONE OR IN CONCOMITANT ASSOCIATION WITH IONIZING RADIATION
THIS RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFIC ROLES OF THESE THREE RESIDUES IN FAST H PROTON RELEASE IN BOTH PR AND BR IN PARTICULAR THE APPARENTLY OBLIGATORY ROLES OF E TWO HUNDRED AND FOUR AND E ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR IN FAST H RELEASE IN BR ARE NOT MATCHED IN PR
THIS RESEARCH EXAMINED THE EXPRESSION AND REGULATION OF THE CATALYTIC SUBUNIT OF THE VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASE IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA AND THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS ON MULTIPLE TRANSCRIPTS GENERATED BY THIS GENE
THIS RESPONSE HAS TYPICALLY BEEN ASSESSED USING MOUSE EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS WHEREIN RB IS BELIEVED TO FACILITATE ARREST BY TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION OF KEY TARGETS
THIS RESULT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE COUPLING OF REACTIVE INTERMEDIATE I WITH THE NEIGHBORING GUANINE BASE CAN COMPETE WITH ITS COUPLING TO MOLECULAR OXYGEN SUGGESTING THAT THIS KIND OF LESION MIGHT BE INDUCED IN CELLULAR DNA BY ENDOGENOUS AND OR EXOGENOUS ROS
THIS RESULT DEMONSTRATES THAT G MC CAN BE INDUCED FROM GAMMA IRRADIATION UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
THIS REVIEW IS INTENDED TO SUMMARIZE WIDELY RECOGNIZED FEATURES OF RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER AND TO ADD A MORE DETAILED OVERVIEW OF RELEVANT RECENT FINDINGS ESPECIALLY FOCUSING ON FACTORS THAT MODIFY THE RADIATION RELATED RISK
THIS SEEMS VALUABLE IN THE PROSPECT OF COMBINING RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE AS AN ADJUVANT TO CONVENTIONAL RADIOTHERAPY AS IT SHOULD PROVIDE STRICTLY ADDITIVE INTERACTION WITHOUT THE LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC ADVERSE EFFECTS INHERENT IN TREATMENTS WITH RADIATION SENSITIZERS
THIS SITUATION OF A SINGLE SUBUNIT A GENE APPEARS TO BE UNUSUAL IN PLANTS
THIS STEP OF THE PURIFICATION YIELDED AN INCREASE IN PROTEIN PURITY TO GREATER THAN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT
THIS STRAIN WAS MUTATED WITH AGROBACTERIUM MEDIATED INTEGRATION OF T DNA CONTAINING THE NAT GENE
THIS STUDY DID NOT ANALYZE CHANGES IN PROTEIN LEVEL IN THE ISOLATED MEMBRANES IN RESPONSE TO CHILLING
THIS STUDY TOGETHER WITH PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS BY BOX CADET AND US DEMONSTRATES CLEARLY THAT A SINGLE PYRIMIDINE BASE RADICAL IS SUFFICIENT FOR INDUCING THE FORMATION OF INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESIONS
THIS SUBUNIT CONTAINS A NUCLEOTIDE BINDING MOTIF AND FUNCTIONS TO BIND AND HYDROLYZE ATP
THIS SUGGESTS THAT RB DEFICIENT CELLS WERE REPLICATING IN THE PRESENCE OF DNA DAMAGE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME POSSIBLY INDUCING SECONDARY LESIONS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO GENOMIC INSTABILITY AND ACTIVATION OF APOPTOTIC PATHWAYS
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOMOLOGS ARE CONSERVED IN EACH PHYLUM AND ARE NOT UNIQUE TO C NEOFORMANS
THIS TYPE OF CHEMISTRY HAS BEEN SHOWN FOR ALL THREE TYPES OF SECONDARY RADICALS FORMED FROM HYDROXYL RADICAL ATTACK ON PYRIDIMINE BASES I E THE FIVE HYDROXY  FIFTY SIX DIHYDROPYRIMID  SIX YL THE SIX HYDROXY  FIFTY SIX DIHYDROPYRIMID  FIVE YL AND THE FIVE PYRIMIDYL METHYL RADICALS
THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY ANCHORING THE DOWNSTREAM PRIMER IN THE POLY A TAIL
THIS WAS ALSO THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION THAT THE COUPLING OF RADICAL I WITH ITS FIVE NEIGHBORING GUANINE CAN OCCUR IN THE PRESENCE OF MOLECULAR OXYGEN SUGGESTING THAT THE FORMATION OF THIS AND OTHER TYPES OF INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESIONS MIGHT HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN THE CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF ROS
THIS WAS TAKEN AS AN INDICATION THAT FARNESYLATED PROTEINS OTHER THAN RAS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THE MODULATION OF RADIATION RESPONSE BY FTI  TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN
THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A PROPOSED MECHANISM FOR FAST H RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED ABOVE PH TEN IN THE BR MUTANT E ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR Q

THUS DOUBLY HETEROZYGOUS MICE REPRESENT A USEFUL MODEL SYSTEM WITH WHICH TO ANALYZE THE INTERACTION OF HETEROZYGOUS GENOTYPES FOR P FIFTY THREE ATM AND OTHER GENES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS
THUS EITHER MODEL OF RB FUNCTION IN CHECKPOINT INDUCTION COULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THAT RB LOSS PREVENTS ITS DIRECT ACTION IN REPLICATION INHIBITION WHILE CONCURRENTLY DISRUPTING ITS FUNCTION IN CONTROL OF DOWNSTREAM TRANSCRIPTIONAL TARGETS
THUS IN ADDITION TO REGULATING DEVELOPMENT BWC ONE BWC TWO ALSO PROMOTE VIRULENCE
THUS INTERESTINGLY THE PATTERN OF LIGHT INDUCTION OF TRANSCRIPT LEVELS IS REVERSED BETWEEN THE TWO GENES IN C NEOFORMANS COMPARED TO N CRASSA
THUS IRRADIATION MAY NOT ELEVATE THE INCIDENCE OF THE TUMOURS

THUS OF THE THREE CANDIDATE PHOTORECEPTOR GENES IDENTIFIED BWC ONE FUNCTIONS IN THE CONTROL OF MATING AND FRUITING BY LIGHT WHEREAS OPS ONE AND PHY ONE DO NOT
THUS ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF STUDYING THE CELLULAR RESPONSE TO UV OR IR IS THE IMMEDIATE INDUCTION OF DNA DAMAGE
THUS RB LOSS ACCELERATES SIX  FOUR PP REPAIR KINETICS
THUS RB LOSS AND TARGET GENE DEREGULATION HASTENS THE REPAIR OF SPECIFIC LESIONS DISTINCT FROM ITS UBIQUITOUS ROLE IN CHECKPOINT ABROGATION
THUS SO FAR FEW STUDIES HAVE FULFILLED ALL OF THESE CRITERIA
THUS THE BWC ONE BWC TWO AND BWC ONE BWC TWO MUTANT STRAINS ALL EXHIBIT SIMILAR PHENOTYPES AND THE DOUBLE MUTANT PHENOTYPE IS NO MORE SEVERE THAN THAT OF THE SINGLE MUTANTS SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PRODUCTS OF THE TWO GENES FUNCTION IN A COMMON PATHWAY

THUS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY OF THE ATM NULL ALLELE IN MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS IS OBSCURE AT PRESENT
THUS THE UNNATURAL BASE PAIR DOES NOT APPEAR TO INDUCE MAJOR STRUCTURAL DISTORTIONS OF THE B FORM DUPLEX
THUS THIS GENE AND ITS HOMOLOGS MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS EVEN TO CULTIVATED EDIBLE FUNGI
THUS WE SOUGHT TO MONITOR THE ACTUAL INDUCTION AND REMOVAL OF THESE LESIONS IMPARTED BY IR AND UV DAMAGE
THUS WE UTILIZED AN KNOCKOUT SYSTEM INVOLVING MICE HARBORING A CONDITIONAL RB ALLELE IN WHICH LOXP SITES FLANK RB EXON NINETEEN RBLOXP LOXP MICE
THUS X IRRADIATION AT FIVE GY AT AGE FIVE WEEKS CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED THE LATENCY PERIOD OF MAMMARY CARCINOMA DEVELOPMENT IN THESE TWO GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT GENOTYPES
TIME RESOLVED UV VIS SPECTROSCOPY METHODS WERE AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY
TIME RESOLVED UV VIS STUDIES AT PH EIGHT ALSO REVEALED THAT THE PROTEIN UNDERGOES A PHOTOCYCLE SIMILAR TO THAT OF WILD TYPE BACTERIORHODOPSIN BUT WITH A PREDOMINANCE OF THE O INTERMEDIATE INSTEAD OF M
TM VALUES ARE IN THE RANGE FORTY SIX  FIFTY ONE C FOR DUPLEXES CONTAINING SEVEN NI AND ALL FOUR NATURAL BASES IN OPPOSITE POSITION IN COMPLEMENTARY STRAND
TO A SOLUTION OF THE COMPOUND TWO SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MG ONE POINT ONE TWO MMOL IN FOUR ML OF PYRIDINE ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MUL TWO POINT TWO FOUR MMOL WAS ADDED SEE FIGURE FOUR
TO ALLOW COMPARISON OF THE KINETIC PARAMETERS FOR ALL SUBSTRATES THE SPECIFICITY CONSTANTS KCAT KM WERE CALCULATED
TO ANALYZE RAPID DNA DAMAGE SIGNALING MAFS INFECTED WITH EITHER AD GFP OR AD GFP CRE WERE TREATED WITH TEN J M TWO UV OR TWO POINT FIVE GY IR AND HARVESTED TWO H FOLLOWING TREATMENT AND ANALYZED FOR TOTAL P FIFTY THREE EXPRESSION BY IMMUNOBLOT FIGURE TWO B TOP PANEL
TO BETTER MIMIC THE EFFECT OF IONIZING RADIATION ON DNA DAMAGE IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED RADICAL I CAN ALSO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF MC G AND G MC IN DUPLEX DNA
TO CIRCUMVENT THIS WE DIGESTED THE DUPLEX IRRADIATION MIXTURE WITH ENZYMES I E NUCLEASE P ONE CIP AND TWO PHOSPHODIESTERASES AND SUBJECTED THE RESULTING DIGESTION MIXTURES TO LC MS MS ANALYSIS
TO CONTROL FOR EQUAL LOADING EXPERIMENTS WERE DONE IN TRIPLICATE AND PERCENT REDUCTION WAS CALCULATED BETWEEN EQUAL DNA CONCENTRATIONS FROM DIFFERENT TIME POINTS WITHIN THE SAME CELL TYPE
TO CREATE A HAPLOID SELF FILAMENTOUS STRAIN OF C NEOFORMANS WE EXPRESSED THE MAT SPECIFIC SXI ONE ALPHA HOMEODOMAIN PROTEIN IN A MATA HAPLOID CELL RESULTING IN ROBUST INDUCTION OF FILAMENT DEVELOPMENT
TO DELINEATE THE CONSEQUENCE OF CONDITIONAL RB ABLATION ON THE RB E TWO F SIGNALING AXIS MAFS INFECTED WITH EITHER AD GFP OR AD GFP CRE WERE HARVESTED FIVE DAYS POST INFECTION AND LEVELS OF SPECIFIC RB TARGET PROTEINS WERE ANALYZED BY IMMUNOBLOT
TO DETERMINE THE APPROXIMATE WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT THAT INHIBIT MATING OF C NEOFORMANS CELL FUSION WAS ASSAYED DURING GROWTH UNDER COLORED FILTERS AT TWENTY FOUR AND FORTY EIGHT H
TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOSS OF RB PROTEIN OR TARGET GENE DEREGULATION IS MORE CLOSELY COUPLED TO LOSS OF CHECKPOINT FUNCTION WE EXAMINED THE DISCRETE KINETICS OF THIS PATHWAY
TO ENSURE THAT ACCELERATION OF SIX  FOUR PP RESOLUTION WAS NOT DUE TO INFECTION WITH AD GFP CRE WILD TYPE MAF CONTROL CELLS RETAINING
TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF RADICAL I IN THE TWO PATHWAYS OUTLINED IN SCHEME THREE I E COUPLING WITH O TWO OR ITS NEIGHBORING GUANINE BASE IT IS IMPORTANT TO COMPARE THE AMOUNTS OF INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK AND SINGLE BASE LESIONS INITIATED FROM RADICAL I UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS
TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THIS IS THE SAME G MC CROSS LINK LESION AS WHAT WAS IDENTIFIED PREVIOUSLY WE DIGESTED THE LESION CONTAINING TWELVE MER THE TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MIN FRACTION AS SHOWN IN FIGURE ONE B WITH NUCLEASE P ONE AND CIP AND SUBJECTED THE RESULTING DIGESTION MIXTURE TO HPLC ANALYSIS
TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF RB IN THE DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE OF ADULT FIBROBLASTS ASYNCHRONOUSLY PROLIFERATING AD GFP OR AD GFP CRE INFECTED MAFS WERE EXPOSED TO ZERO TEN OR TWENTY J M TWO UV AND SUBSEQUENTLY CULTURED FOR TEN H TO ELICIT THE CHECKPOINT RESPONSE
TO EXAMINE THE ACTION OF RB IN CELLS MAFS WERE INITIALLY INFECTED WITH RECOMBINANT ADENOVIRUSES EXPRESSING BOTH GFP AND CRE RECOMBINASE AD GFP CRE OR GFP ALONE AD GFP AS A CONTROL
TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE CROSS LINK LESION CAN ALSO BE GENERATED IN ODNS WE IRRADIATED RADICAL PRECURSOR CONTAINING ODNS UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS AND SEPARATED THE RESULTING PRODUCTS BY HPLC
TO FURTHER EXPLORE THIS POSSIBILITY WE WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FORMATION OF THIS LESION IN VIVO AND TO EXAMINE THE MUTAGENIC PROPERTIES OF THIS LESION
TO FURTHER PROBE THE INDUCTION KINETICS OF P FIFTY THREE PHOSPHO P FIFTY THREE EXPRESSION WAS ANALYZED AT ZERO ONE THREE AND FIVE H POST TREATMENT FIGURE TWO B BOTTOM PANEL
TO IDENTIFY OTHER COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR RESPONSES TO LIGHT A NOVEL SELF FERTILE HAPLOID STRAIN WAS CREATED AND SUBJECTED TO AGROBACTERIUM MEDIATED INSERTIONAL MUTAGENESIS
TO INVESTIGATE CELL CYCLE REDISTRIBUTION BY RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MIAPACA  TWO AND A  FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE CELLS WERE EXPOSED FOR FIVE DAYS TO ONE X IC FIFTY OR TEN X IC FIFTY FTI RELATIVE TO THE CELL LINE OF INTEREST AND SUBMITTED OR NOT TO GAMMA RAYS TWENTY FOUR H BEFORE HARVEST
TO MONITOR THE INDUCTION OF UV LESIONS IN THE SINGLE CELL THE ABUNDANCE OF SIX  FOUR PPS WAS EXAMINED BY IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING DAMAGE T EQUAL TO ZERO H AND AFTER TWENTY FOUR H OF RECOVERY T EQUAL TO TWENTY FOUR H FIGURE FOUR D
TO MORE CLOSELY EXAMINE THE KINETICS OF SIX  FOUR PP REPAIR AD GFP AND AD GFP CRE INFECTED CELLS WERE TREATED WITH ZERO TEN OR TWENTY J M TWO UV AND HARVESTED FOR SIX  FOUR PP ANALYSIS AT ZERO TWO FIVE AND TWENTY FOUR H FOLLOWING DAMAGE
TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE FORMATION OF INTRASTRAND OXIDATIVE CROSS LINK LESION UNDER AEROBIC CONDITIONS HAS NEVER BEEN SHOWN PREVIOUSLY
TO PROBE THESE RESPONSES WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF RB IN UV AND IR DAMAGE SIGNALING CHECKPOINT ACTIVATION AND LESION REPAIR IN ADULT PRIMARY CELLS CONTAINING ACUTE RB LOSS
TO SEARCH FURTHER FOR A FUNCTION OF OPS ONE PHY ONE AND BWC ONE GROWTH OF THE SINGLE AND MULTIPLE MUTANT STRAINS WAS EXAMINED UNDER A VARIETY OF IN VITRO CONDITIONS
TO SUBSEQUENTLY CHARACTERIZE EXPRESSION LEVELS OF DOWNSTREAM RB TARGETS AD GFP AND AD GFP CRE INFECTED MAFS WERE ANALYZED AT ZERO THREE AND FIVE H FOLLOWING TEN J M TWO UV FIGURE TWO C TOP PANEL OR TWO POINT FIVE GY IR FIGURE TWO C BOTTOM PANEL EXPOSURE

TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS WE INITIATED EFFORTS TO ANALYZE THE PHOTOCHEMISTRY OF BWC ONE
TO THIS END WE CARRIED OUT THE UV C IRRADIATION OF A DUPLEX D ACGTGYCGTGAT D ATCACGGCACGT UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
TO THIS END WE IRRADIATED A SELF COMPLEMENTARY ODN D MCG  SEVEN UNDER EITHER AEROBIC OR ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
TO THIS SOLUTION TWO CHLORO  FOUR H  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO BENZODIOXAPHOSPHORIN  FOUR ONE TWO HUNDRED MUL OF ONE M SOLUTION FRESHLY PREPARED IN DRY DIOXANE TWO HUNDRED MUMOL WAS ADDED AND STIRRED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE UNDER ARGON FOR TWENTY MIN
TO UNDERSTAND THE KINETICS OF CELL CYCLE ATTENUATION FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO UV AND IR AD GFP AND AD GFP CRE INFECTED MAFS WERE EXPOSED TO EITHER ZERO TEN OR TWENTY J M TWO UV OR ZERO TWO POINT FIVE OR FIVE GY IR AND CULTURED
TO VISUALIZE LAMIN CELLS WERE FIXED IN ACETONE METHANOL ONE  ONE V V FOR TWENTY MIN AT TWENTY C ALLOWED TO AIR DRY THEN WASHED THREE TIMES WITH PBS AND TREATED WITH ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT TRITON X  ONE HUNDRED FOR FIVE MIN AT FOUR C TO PERMEABILIZE CELLS

TO VISUALIZE POLYMERIZED ACTIN AND TUBULIN CELLS WERE PROCESSED ACCORDING TO MIES ET AL
TOGETHER THESE DATA INDICATE THAT WHILE RB LOSS PLAYS NO APPARENT ROLE IN THE REPAIR OF IR LESIONS E G DNA DOUBLE STRAND BREAKS THE LOSS OF RB ACCELERATES THE REPAIR OF UV INDUCED SIX  FOUR PPS
TOGETHER THESE DATA REVEAL THAT THE KINETICS OF RB LOSS ARE CONCOMITANT WITH TARGET GENE DEREGULATION AND IMPAIRED DNA DAMAGE CHECKPOINT RESPONSE

TWENTY EIGHT P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM TWENTY TWO P FIFTY THREE PLUS ATM ELEVEN P FIFTY THREE PLUS PLUS ATM AND TWENTY FIVE P FIFTY THREE PLUS PLUS ATM MICE WERE EXAMINED FOR SPONTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT OF TUMOURS UNTIL AGE TWENTY SIX MONTHS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN WEEKS
TWO ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THESE OBSERVATIONS NAMELY INHIBITION OF THE FARNESYLATION OF P TWENTY ONE RAS OR RELATED PROTEINS FROM THE RAS SUPERFAMILY OR INHIBITION OF THE FARNESYLATION OF OTHER PROTEINS RESULTING IN DISRUPTION OF THE MITOTIC APPARATUS OR CYTOKINESIS TRAVERSE
TWO APPROACHES WERE EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY GENES REGULATING THESE RESPONSES TO LIGHT
TWO GENES CONTROLLING LIGHT RESPONSES BWC ONE AND BWC TWO WERE IDENTIFIED AND SHOWN TO REGULATE DEVELOPMENT AND VIRULENCE OF THE FUNGAL PATHOGEN CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS
TWO GENES CONTROLLING LIGHT RESPONSES WERE DISCOVERED THROUGH CANDIDATE GENE AND INSERTIONAL MUTAGENESIS APPROACHES
TWO METHODS WERE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE RESULTED OR NOT IN AN ALTERED RADIATION SURVIVAL
TWO OTHER RECENT EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER FOR ALL WOMEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION BEFORE AGE TWENTY YEARS NAMELY THE ATOMIC BOMB SURVIVOR STUDIES AND THE CANADIAN FLUOROSCOPY COHORT STUDY
TWO PHYTOCHROME HOMOLOGS HAVE BEEN NOTED IN THE GENOME OF N CRASSA BUT ALSO HAVE AS YET NO KNOWN FUNCTION

UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SIGNALS IN FUNGAL DEVELOPMENT IS VITAL TO INCREASE THE BENEFITS AND DECREASE THE COSTS THAT FUNGI PRESENT
UNFORTUNATELY FIVE HYDROXYMETHYL  TWO DEOXYCYTIDINE IS POORLY RESOLVED ON TWO TYPES OF REVERSE PHASE COLUMNS THAT WE TESTED
UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A FEW EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES COLLECTED THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AND WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS WITH SUFFICIENT STATISTICAL POWER
UNFORTUNATELY OWING TO INTERSPECIES AND INTRASPECIES VARIABILITY AND THE OBVIOUS COMPLEXITY OF MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS THESE DATA DO NOT PROVIDE A UNIFIED MODEL TO EXPLAIN VARIATION IN HUMAN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO RADIATION ASSOCIATED MAMMARY CANCER
UNIVERSAL DNA BASE ANALOGS HAVING PHOTOCLEAVABLE PROPERTIES WOULD BE OF GREAT INTEREST FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NEW NUCLEIC ACID FRAGMENTATION TOOLS
UNTIL RECENTLY THERE WAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS ON BREAST CANCER RISK OF RADIATION EXPOSURES THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE FIRST VERSUS THE SECOND DECADE OF LIFE FOR TWO REASONS
UPON COLLISIONAL ACTIVATION IN A MASS SPECTROMETER AN ODN UNDERGOES CLEAVAGES AT THE N GLYCOSIDIC BOND AND THE THREE C O BOND OF THE SAME NUCLEOTIDE TO YIELD AN BASE AND WN IONS
UPON MATURATION THE VACUOLAR CONTENTS CAN COMPRISE MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL CELL VOLUME
USING A DATABASE OF ALMOST FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TWINS LICHTENSTEIN AND COLLEAGUES ESTIMATED THAT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL BREAST CANCER CAN BE EXPLAINED BY GENETIC FACTORS OR THEIR INTERACTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ALTHOUGH INHERITED SUSCEPTIBILITY MUTATIONS IN BCRA ONE AND BRCA TWO SEEM TO ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF ALL BREAST CANCER CASES IRRESPECTIVE OF FAMILY HISTORY

V ATPASE PROTEOLIPID ISOFORMS WERE SHOWN TO EXHIBIT DIFFERENTIAL TRANSCRIPT EXPRESSION LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES
V ATPASES ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN PLANTS' DEFENSE AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS
VACUOLAR TYPE ATPASES ARE HOMOLOGS OF THE F TYPE ATP SYNTHASES AND PROBABLY CONVERT THE FREE ENERGY OF HYDROLYSIS OF THE HIGH ENERGY PHOSPHATE BOND INTO ROTATIONAL MOTION
VACUOLAR TYPE ATPASES ARE HOUSEKEEPING ENZYMES CRITICAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HOMEOSTASIS
VACUOLAR TYPE ATPASES ARE HOUSEKEEPING ENZYMES PROBABLY NEEDED IN ALL LIVING PLANT CELLS
VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASES ARE CRITICAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HOMEOSTASIS IN EUKARYOTIC CELLS
VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASES ARE ENZYMES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENERGIZATION OF MEMBRANES AND THE ACIDIFICATION OF COMPARTMENTS WITHIN THE EUKARYOTIC CELL VIA THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTON AND ELECTROCHEMICAL GRADIENTS AT THE EXPENSE OF ATP
VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASES ARE LARGE MULTIMERIC ENZYME COMPLEXES OF FIVE HUNDRED  SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY KDA CONSISTING OF FIFTEEN OR MORE DIFFERENT PROTEINS
VACUOLAR TYPE H ATPASES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF VACUOLAR HOMEOSTASIS IN PLANT CELLS
VALUES VARY IN THE RANGE FORTY NINE  FIFTY TWO C FOR THE ANALOGOUS DUPLEXES CONTAINING FIVE NI
VARIOUS TYPES OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY IONIZING RADIATION INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE DAMAGE TO SINGLE BASES SINGLE STRAND BREAKS DOUBLE STRAND BREAKS DSBS AND MULTIPLY DAMAGED SITES
WAS ADDED ANTI DIGOXIGENIN FAB FRAGMENT ANTIBODY DILUTED TWENTY THOUSAND  ONE CONJUGATED WITH ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE BOEHRINGER MANNHEIM BIOCHEMICAL PRODUCTS INDIANAPOLIS IN
WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS A POST TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE THREE NATIVE CYSTEINES WHEN PR IS EXPRESSED IN E COLI
WE ALSO DESCRIBE ENZYMATIC EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY THE RECOGNITION OF THIS UNNATURAL NUCLEOSIDE INCORPORATED IN OLIGONUCLEOTIDES BY THE DNA POLYMERASE KLENOW FRAGMENT EXONUCLEASE FREE AS WELL AS THE SYNTHESIS AND INCORPORATION OF THE D  SEVEN NI TRIPHOSPHATE BY THE POLYMERASE
WE ALSO DETECTED THE D MC G FROM THE ENZYMIC DIGESTION MIXTURE WITH FOUR ENZYMES AS STATED IN THE MATERIALS AND METHODS OF THE UV C IRRADIATION PRODUCTS OF D ACGTGCYGTGAT
WE ALSO EXAMINED INCORPORATION OF THE D  SEVEN NI TRIPHOSPHATE OPPOSITE EACH NATURAL BASE IN THE TEMPLATE
WE ALSO EXAMINED THE REACTIVITIES OF THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED RADICAL THROUGH PRODUCT ANALYSIS
WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE SAME G MC CROSS LINK LESION CAN BE INDUCED FROM THE GAMMA IRRADIATION OF GMC CONTAINING DUPLEX ODN UNDER BOTH AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS THE YIELD FOR THE FORMATION OF CROSS LINK LESION IN ANOXIC SOLUTION IS TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT IN OXYGENATED SOLUTION
WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF THE SEQUENCE ON NUCLEOSIDE INCORPORATION OPPOSITE D  SEVEN NI
WE ALSO SHOWED BY LC MS MS THAT THE SAME CROSS LINK LESIONS WERE FORMED IN MC CONTAINING DUPLEX ODNS UPON GAMMA IRRADIATION UNDER BOTH AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS AND THE YIELD WAS TEN FOLD HIGHER UNDER THE LATTER CONDITIONS
WE ALSO SHOWED THAT THE INDEPENDENTLY GENERATED I IN DINUCLEOSIDE MONOPHOSPHATES CAN RESULT IN THE FACILE FORMATION OF TWO INTRASTRAND CROSS LINK LESIONS MC G AND G MC IN WHICH THE METHYL CARBON ATOM OF FIVE METHYLCYTOSINE AND THE C EIGHT CARBON ATOM OF ITS ADJACENT GUANINE ARE COVALENTLY BONDED SCHEME ONE
WE ALSO STUDIED THE EXTENSION OF PRIMERS TERMINATED BY THE UNNATURAL BASE SEVEN NI
WE ALSO TESTED VIRULENCE BECAUSE SEVERAL SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS AFFECTING C NEOFORMANS MATING ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON VIRULENCE
WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF SYNTHESIZING SUCH LABELED COMPOUNDS AND THE RESULTS FROM THOSE STUDIES WILL BE REPORTED IN DUE COURSE
WE CAN ALSO DETECT A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE DINUCLEOSIDE PRODUCT TWO SCHEME THREE M Z FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN WHEREAS NEITHER THE TRINUCLEOSIDE DIPHOSPHATE THREE SCHEME THREE M Z EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT NOR THE TRINUCLEOSIDE MONOPHOSPHATE FOUR SCHEME THREE M Z EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX IS DETECTABLE UNDER THIS DIGESTION CONDITION SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURE S FIFTEEN
WE CHOSE THOSE FOUR ENZYMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN USED BY BELLON ET AL
WE CHOSE TO EXAMINE THIS GENE FURTHER BECAUSE ITS STRUCTURE SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT PHYSICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY INTERACT WITH THE C NEOFORMANS BWC ONE PROTEIN
WE CONCLUDE THAT BWC ONE FUNCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO BLUE LIGHT TO INHIBIT MATING AND TO UV LIGHT TO REGULATE RESISTANCE TO UV IRRADIATION
WE CONFIRMED THIS RESULT USING CRUDE E COLI MEMBRANES WITHOUT DETERGENT PRESENT DATA NOT SHOWN
WE DEMONSTRATE THAT RB LOSS COMPROMISES RAPID CELL CYCLE ARREST FOLLOWING UV AND IR EXPOSURE IN ADULT PRIMARY CELLS
WE DETERMINED THAT THE FRACTION ELUTING AT THIRTY SIX POINT EIGHT MIN FIGURE THREE A IS THE D G MC CROSS LINK LESION THAT WE IDENTIFIED PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE THIS FRACTION NOT ONLY CO ELUTES WITH THE D G MC STANDARD FIGURE THREE B BUT ALSO EXHIBITS THE SAME MS AND MS MS AS THE STANDARD D G MC DATA NOT SHOWN
WE EXPECT THAT THE YIELD COMING FROM THE ANALYSIS WITH THE ODN AS STANDARD IS MORE ACCURATE THAN THAT WITH THE D G MC AS STANDARD BECAUSE IDENTICAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES ENZYMIC DIGESTION CHLOROFORM EXTRACTION ETC WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE SAMPLE AND THE ODN STANDARD
WE FOCUSED ON THE PHEROMONE GENES BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT CELL CELL SIGNALING MOLECULES AND BECAUSE MFALPHA ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE TRIPLE MUTANT STRAINS EXHIBIT A REDUCTION IN FUSION EFFICIENCY SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN BWC ONE MUTANT STRAINS
WE FOUND THAT SEVEN NI BEHAVES AS CHAIN TERMINATOR WHEN FACING ADENINE GUANINE OR CYTOSINE IN THE TEMPLATE
WE FURTHER DETERMINED THE YIELD FOR THE FORMATION OF THE G MC LESION BY LC MS MS
WE HAVE STUDIED THE IMPACT ON DNA DUPLEX STABILITY OF THE PRESENCE OF THE D  SEVEN NI UNNATURAL BASE OPPOSITE EACH NATIVE BASE
WE HOWEVER BELIEVE THAT IT IS VERY UNLIKELY FOR THE SOLUTION TO BE COMPLETELY DEPLETED OF OXYGEN DURING THE COURSE OF IRRADIATION
WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT PHOTONS PERCEIVED THROUGH A FLAVIN COFACTOR CAUSE A CONFORMATIONAL CHANGE THAT ENHANCES REPRESSION OF FILAMENT FORMATION AND CELL FUSION AND ACTIVATES TRANSCRIPTION OF GENES REQUIRED FOR UV RESISTANCE DNA REPAIR
WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT BWC ONE BINDS TO AN INTERACTING DNA BINDING PROTEIN BECAUSE BWC ONE WOULD BE UNABLE TO ACT AS A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ON ITS OWN
WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE FUNGUS MAY BE ABLE TO SENSE DARKNESS WITHIN THE MAMMALIAN HOST AND USE THIS AS A SIGNAL POSSIBLY VIA BWC ONE BWC TWO TO INDUCE VIRULENCE
WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THERE MUST BE A SECOND PROTEIN THAT INTERACTS WITH BWC ONE AND SET OUT TO IDENTIFY THIS COMPONENT VIA RANDOM INSERTIONAL MUTAGENESIS
WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT TRANSCRIPTION OF THE C NEOFORMANS PHEROMONE OR HOMEODOMAIN GENES WOULD BE CONTROLLED VIA BWC ONE BWC TWO
WE IDENTIFY HERE TWO GENES REQUIRED FOR C NEOFORMANS RESPONSES TO LIGHT AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR ROLE IN BLUE LIGHT REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENT AND SENSITIVITY TO UV LIGHT AND THEIR REQUIREMENT FOR FULL VIRULENCE OF THIS PATHOGEN IN A MAMMALIAN HOST
WE LOOKED FOR ITS PRESENCE IN PARTIALLY PURIFIED SAMPLES RECONSTITUTED IN DHPC IN THE PH RANGE SIX  ELEVEN
WE OBSERVED THAT THE NATURE OF THE DOWNSTREAM TEMPLATE BASE WAS WITHOUT EFFECT ON THE SELECTIVITY OF THE REACTION INSERTION OF DAMP OPPOSITE THE UNNATURAL BASE WAS FAVORED OVER DGMP DTMP AND DCMP
WE PREDICT THAT SOME OF THESE KNOWN MUTATIONS WILL BE FOUND TO AFFECT WHITE COLLAR HOMOLOGS
WE PRESUME THAT HIGH BASAL LEVELS OF PROTEINS SUCH AS PCNA ENABLE THE RB DEFICIENT CELLS TO COMPLETE REPAIR PROCESSES MORE QUICKLY AS WE FOUND THAT PCNA PROTEIN EXPRESSION RAPIDLY SHIFTED FROM DIFFUSE PUNCTATE PATTERNING INDICATIVE OF ITS FUNCTION IN REPAIR TO FOCAL EXPRESSION EVIDENT IN NORMAL REPLICATION FIGURE SIX
WE PROPOSE A MODEL FOR BWC ONE BWC TWO FUNCTION THAT IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF WC  ONE WC  TWO OF N CRASSA BUT DIFFERS IN SEVERAL KEY FEATURES FIGURE NINE
WE REASONED THAT SUCH A SELF FILAMETOUS STRAIN COULD BE EMPLOYED TO PERFORM RANDOM INSERTIONAL MUTAGENESIS AND DEVISED A SCREEN TO IDENTIFY THE HYPOTHETICAL PROTEIN INTERACTING WITH BWC ONE
WE REPORTED THE SYNTHESIS STRUCTURE AND PHOTOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SEVEN NITROINDOLE NUCLEOSIDE D  SEVEN NI
WE SET OUT TO IDENTIFY GENES INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS BY WHICH LIGHT INHIBITS MATING OF THE BASIDIOMYCETE CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS
WE SHOW HERE THAT RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE RADIATION SUSCEPTIBILITY OF HUMAN CELLS BEARING K RAS MUTATION
WE SHOWED RECENTLY THAT GAMMA IRRADIATION OF DUPLEX DNA CAN INDUCE THE FORMATION OF THIS KIND OF LESION AT FIVE GC  THREE BUT NOT AT FIVE CG  THREE SITE
WE SYNTHESIZED ODNS CONTAINING A SITE SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATED FIVE PHENYLTHIOMETHYL  TWO DEOXYCYTIDINE WHICH UPON UV C IRRADIATION RELEASES THE FIVE  TWO DEOXYCYTIDYL METHYL RADICAL IN THESE ODNS
WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY OF THE ATM GENE ON MAMMARY TUMOURIGENESIS AFTER X IRRADIATION IN THE P FIFTY THREE PLUS MICE OF THE BALB CHEA X MSM MS BACKGROUND
WE THEN DIGESTED THE IRRADIATION MIXTURE WITH FOUR ENZYMES I E NUCLEASE P ONE CIP AND TWO PHOSPHODIESTERASES OR WITH ONLY TWO ENZYMES NUCLEASE P ONE AND CIP AND SUBJECTED THE RESULTING PRODUCTS TO LC MS MS ANALYSIS
WE THEREFORE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF FIFTY NM OR FIVE HUNDRED NM RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE ON THE PLOIDY AND CHROMOSOME INTEGRITY IN HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN CELLS EXPOSED TO RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE AND OR RADIATION
WE THEREFORE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF FIFTY NM OR FIVE HUNDRED NM RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIN AND TUBULIN NETWORKS IN HCT  ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN CELLS EXPOSED TO RPR  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE AND OR RADIATION
WE TRIED TO RESOLVE THE COMPONENTS IN THE UV C IRRADIATION MIXTURE OF THE DUPLEX DNA BY HPLC THE LESION BEARING STRAND HOWEVER CO MIGRATES WITH THE COMPLEMENTARY STRAND ON THE HPLC COLUMN PREVENTING US FROM OBTAINING PURE SINGLE STRANDED ODNS FOR FURTHER CHARACTERIZATIONS
WE USED A GRADIENT OF ZERO  TWENTY PERCENT B ZERO  FIVE MIN AND TWENTY  FORTY FIVE PERCENT B FIVE  FIFTY MIN FOR THE PURIFICATION OF RADICAL PRECURSOR CONTAINING ODNS
WEAK RADIOSENSITIZATION ONLY WAS OBTAINED WITH FTI  TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN IN K RAS MUTANTS UNLESS FTI  TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN WAS COMBINED WITH GGTI  TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT TO HINDER GERANYLGERANYL TRANSFER TO K RAS
WHAT IS LACKING IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF VACUOLAR TYPE ATPASES IS A SENSE OF WHAT PURPOSE THESE MULTIGENE FAMILY PROTEINS MAY SERVE IN THE CELLULAR MILIEU AND HOW THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE GROWTH DEVELOPMENT AND METABOLISM OF HIGHER PLANTS
WHEN A WILD TYPE COPY OF THE BWC TWO GENE WAS REINTRODUCED INTO THE BWC TWO MUTANT STRAIN UV SENSITIVITY AND INHIBITION OF MATING BY LIGHT WERE RESTORED TO THE WILD TYPE LEVEL UNPUBLISHED DATA
WHEN CROSSED TO SEROTYPE D BWC ONE STRAINS WILD TYPE SEROTYPE
WHEN DATP WAS ADDED DUPLEX IN WHICH N TWENTY IS THYMINE THE SEVEN NI PRIMER WAS ELONGATED BY ONE OR TWO UNITS FIGURE NINE LANE THREE
WHEN THE AVERAGE MULTIPLICITY WAS LESS THAN ONE POINT ONE FOR ONE AND TWO H DRUG EXPOSURE NO CORRECTION WAS APPLIED
WHEN THE N O TRANSITION TAKES PLACE IN BR H IS TAKEN UP FROM THE MEDIUM RAISING THE PH ONCE AGAIN
WHEN THE SURVIVORS WERE CLASSIFIED BY AGE AT HL DIAGNOSIS AND ATTAINED AGE THE HIGHEST RISK WAS SEEN FOR EARLY ONSET BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSED BEFORE AGE FORTY YEARS AMONG THE GROUP OF WOMEN TREATED FOR HL BEFORE AGE TWENTY YEARS RELATIVE RISK THIRTY THREE POINT TWO
WHEN USING THE SEVEN NI CONTAINING STRAND AS TEMPLATE SEQUENCE TEN DAMP DGMP AND DTMP WERE INCORPORATED OPPOSITE THE UNNATURAL BASE HOWEVER WITH QUITE DIFFERENT EFFICIENCIES FIGURE FIVE LANES ONE THREE AND FOUR WHILE INSERTION OF DCMP COULD NOT BE DETECTED FIGURE FIVE LANE TWO
WHERE S ZERO IS THE CLONOGENIC EFFICIENCY S THE RESIDUAL SURVIVAL D THE RADIATION DOSE AND ALPHA AND BETA NUMERICAL PARAMETERS CHARACTERIZING THE RADIOSENSITIVITY OF THE CELL LINE
WHERE SEXP IS THE EXPERIMENTAL CELL SURVIVAL DETERMINED FROM BULK COLONY SCORING AND AN THE FRACTION OF COLONY FORMING UNITS WITH N VIABLE CELLS WAS USED IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE SINGLE CELL SURVIVING FRACTION SCSF
WHERE THE LENGTH OF DRUG EXPOSURE WAS IN EXCESS OF TWELVE H CELLS WERE PLATED AFTER TREATMENTS TO AVOID BIASES DUE TO THE FORMATION OF MICROCOLONIES
WHEREAS RB DID NOT AFFECT RESOLUTION OF DNA DOUBLE STRAND BREAKS RB DEFICIENT CELLS EXHIBITED ACCELERATED REPAIR OF PYRIMIDINE PYRIMIDONE PHOTOPRODUCTS SIX  FOUR PP
WHETHER AND HOW FTASE INHIBITION MAY AFFECT THE RESPONSE OF CELLS TO IONIZING RADIATION HAS ALSO BEEN A LONG STANDING PROBLEM
WHILE RB IS IMPLICATED IN GROSS CHROMOSOME INSTABILITY ITS EFFECT ON DNA REPAIR REMAINS UNEXPLORED
WHILE SPECTRAL ANALYSES AND THE MORPHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF LIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL CHARACTERIZED IN GENERA SUCH AS COPRINUS A BASIDIOMYCETE OR PHYCOMYCES A ZYGOMYCETE AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL NEUROSPORA CRASSA AN ASCOMYCETE IS BEST UNDERSTOOD BASED ON THE FUNCTIONS OF THE WHITE COLLAR WC  ONE AND WC  TWO GENES IN LIGHT SENSING
WHOLE GENOME BLOT ANALYSIS DETECTED A SINGLE GENE IN THE A THALIANA GENOME
WHOLE RNA BLOT ANALYSIS PERFORMED ON SEEDLINGS EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS CONDITIONS INDICATED THAT TRANSCRIPT LEVELS OF SUBUNIT A WERE RESPONSIVE TO SALT AND COLD STRESS TREATMENTS
WHOLE RNA BLOT ANALYSIS WAS USED FIRST TO EVALUATE THE OVERALL RESPONSE OF SUBUNIT A TO STRESS CONDITIONS
WHOLE RNA WAS DILUTED TO A CONCENTRATION OF ZERO POINT SIX SEVEN MUG MUL IN A TOTAL VOLUME OF TEN  FIFTEEN MUL
WHOLE RNA WAS EXTRACTED FROM SEEDLINGS AND CDNA WAS GENERATED USING OLIGO DT AS DESCRIBED IN MATERIALS AND METHODS
WHOLE RNA WAS HARVESTED FROM LEAVES BOLTS SILIQUES FLOWERS AXENICALLY GROWN SEEDLINGS AND AXENICALLY GROWN ROOTS
WILD TYPE ATM ALLELE WAS ALSO RETAINED IN NINE OUT OF TEN MAMMARY CARCINOMAS FROM NONIRRADIATED ATM MICE AND IN ALL OF FIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMAS FROM NONIRRADIATED ATM MICE
WILD TYPE CELLS WERE TREATED WITH UV AND MONITORED FOR SIX  FOUR PP REPAIR AS IN THE TOP PANEL OF FIGURE FOUR E TO REVEAL THAT IT IS INDEED RB LOSS WHICH ENHANCES SIX  FOUR PP REPAIR RATHER THAN AD GFP CRE INFECTION FIGURE FOUR E BOTTOM PANEL
WITH REGARD TO PUBERTY EARLIER EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES WITH SHORT FOLLOW UP OR STUDIES WITH PARTIAL COVERAGE OF POTENTIAL AGE WINDOWS OF EXPOSURE HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND THE SECOND DECADE OF LIFE TO REPRESENT THE MOST SENSITIVE WINDOW IN TERMS OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER
WITH TEMPLATE CONTAINING D  SEVEN NI SEQUENCE TEN DAMP WAS PREFERENTIALLY INSERTED OPPOSITE THE MODIFIED SITE
WITH THE SAME DOSE OF IRRADIATION THE YIELDS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MC G ON THE OTHER HAND WERE DETERMINED TO BE THIRTY SIX AND ONE LESIONS PER ONE HUNDRED AND SIX MCG SITES UNDER ANAEROBIC AND AEROBIC CONDITIONS RESPECTIVELY TABLE ONE
WITH THESE CELLS LAMIN B WAS NOT STRICTLY CONFINED IN THE NUCLEUS AS INDICATED BY CYTOPLASMIC PATCHES FIGURE FIVE H
WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS IN SUPPORT OF INCREASED RADIORESISTANCE EARLY STUDIES ON HUMAN CELLS DID NOT SHOW ANY CLEAR CUT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RADIATION SENSITIVITY AND EXPRESSION OF ONCOGENIC RAS
WITHOUT AUTHENTIC STABLE ISOTOPE LABELED SINGLE BASE LESIONS THE LC MS MS METHOD IS NOT RELIABLE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNTS OF THE TWO SINGLE BASE LESIONS FORMED FROM GAMMA IRRADIATION
WOMEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF AGE OLD AT EXPOSURE HAVE NO MEASURABLY INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER
WOMEN WHO HAVE A LATE MENARCHE AND OR EARLY MENOPAUSE HAVE A SMALLER NUMBER OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES AND THEREFORE SHORTER EXPOSURE TO OVARIAN HORMONES DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE YEARS THAN WOMEN WHO HAVE EARLY MENARCHE AND OR LATE MENOPAUSE
WOMEN YOUNGER THAN AGE TWENTY YEARS AT EXPOSURE ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF RADIATION ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER THAN THOSE EXPOSED AT OLDER AGES
