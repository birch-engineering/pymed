Background
Growth inhibition by RPR-130401, a non-peptidomimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor, was investigated without or with combined exposure to ionizing radiation in three human tumor cell lines (HCT-116, MiAPaCa-2 and A-549) bearing a point mutation in the K-Ras gene.
Results
RPR-130401 inhibited cell growth with an IC50 of 50 nM (HCT-116), 120 nM (MiAPaCa-2) and 710 nM (A-549), with a poor incidence of apoptosis.
The drug brought about G1 and S phase depletion together with arrest of cells in G2 phase and induced a significant accumulation of hyperploid cells showing active S phase DNA synthesis, with HCT-116 and A-549 cells being the most and least responsive, respectively.
The drug also produced dramatic changes of the nuclear lamin B pattern, without lamin B cleavage and perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton.
On the other hand, RPR-130401 elicited strictly additive interaction in combined treatment with ionizing radiation with regard to cell kill, altered cell cycle progression and induced hyperploidy.
Conclusions
The data suggest that disruption of orderly progression through mitosis and cytokinesis, is a major outcome of drug action and that this effect proceeds from inhibition of lamin B farnesylation.
It is anticipated from the strict additivity of RPR-130401 and radiation that neither induced radiation resistance nor acute or late complications of radiotherapy, should occur in combined treatment with RPR-130401.
For over ten years chemo-radiotherapeutic combinations have evolved as prevalent modalities in the cure of solid tumors.
The rationale for these treatments relies mostly on the drugs' ability to sterilize disseminated metastases (spatial cooperation) and on radiation-drug interaction for improved local control of the primary tumor.
Supraadditive interaction, often resulting from impaired repair of radiation-induced sublethal damage, may lead to limiting toxicities.
In contrast, pure additivity of the treatments may conceivably be turned to advantage because the dose-dependent response of cells to radiation includes a quadratic term.
This is of concern, for example, to farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) of which six have already been tested in phase
I clinical trials with most attention being paid to the non-peptidomimetic R115777.
As one may expect a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect from FTIs, assays of combined modality treatment with cytotoxic agents applied in close temporal proximity should be performed.
This prompted us to investigate the cells' response to RPR-130401 (Scheme 1), a non-peptidomimetic FTI issued from chemical optimization from series selected by random screening at Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer Co., both alone or in concomitant association with ionizing radiation.
A comprehensive approach to these problems requires an insight into the molecular targets of drug action.
Together with mutation or deletion of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, mutations in one of the four Ras genes (H-, N-, KA- and KB-Ras) represent the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancers with predominance in pancreatic (90%), colorectal (50%) and lung (20%) tumors (for a review on ras mutations in relation to oncogenic transformation see).
Activation of Ras proteins requires prenylation of the CAAX sequence at their C-terminus, to ultimately permit their association with other proteins or with the inner face of the plasma membrane.
A key step in this process is catalyzed by farnesyltransferase (FTase).
The K-Ras protein can alternatively be prenylated by type I geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase I), a closely related enzyme.
FTase has been a very attractive target for antitumor drug discovery because prenylation is required for oncogenic Ras to transform cells.
Numerous inhibitors have been developed, including FPP analogs, CAAX peptide analogs, bisubstrate analogs and more recently GGTase I inhibitors.
However, it is now known that a range of non-Ras proteins are targets for prenylation.
In spite of this, the quest for specific FTase-targeting drugs that would not affect GGTase is still pertinent, because geranylgeranylation of normal cellular proteins is five to ten times more prevalent than farnesylation.
RPR-130401 acts as a competitive inhibitor of the FPP substrate with respect to the farnesylated proteins, with an IC50 of 28 nM for the inhibition of K-Ras prenylation in vitro, and has demonstrated in vivo antitumor activity in mice bearing human carcinoma xenografts.
RPR-130401 is highly selective (more than 300-fold) for FTase with regards to GGTase, an unexpected result since GGTase can accommodate and transfer both FPP and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to CAAX-motifs in proteins.
Consistently, RPR-130401 efficiently inhibits Ras farnesylation in cells but does not block geranylgeranyl transfer to Ras.
RPR-130401 is also very efficient in inhibiting lamin B farnesylation.
The lack of protein substrate specificity is of particular interest for the development of this series of FTIs, as non-Ras farnesylated proteins may participate in transformation by Ras-dependent or -independent pathways.
The discovery of prenylation-dependent oncogenic protein tyrosine phosphatases harboring a CAAX-box strengthens the interest for such FTIs as RPR-130401.
For studies with RPR-130401 we chose three cell lines bearing a K-Ras allele with a point mutation, namely, the human colon adenocarcinoma HCT-116 with mutation at codon 13, the human pancreatic carcinoma MiAPaCa-2 with mutation at codon 12, and the human lung carcinoma A-549 with another mutation at codon 12.
Cell growth or survival, cell cycle progression, ploidy, lamin B structure in nuclear lamina, cytoskeleton framework, and lamin B fragmentation were taken as an endpoint in single or combined treatment with ionizing radiation.
The data show that RPR-130401 affects the integrity of the lamin B network, resulting in an aberrant onset of mitosis and cytokinesis and ensuing hyperploidy without significant changes in radiation susceptibility.
The response of HCT-116, A-549 and MiAPaCa-2 cells to RPR-130401 was investigated through growth inhibition assays with exponentially growing subcultures.
Cells were exposed to the drug for up to 7-days at concentrations in the range 2.5-7,000 nM. RPR-130401 was found to inhibit cell growth with an IC50 of 50 nM for HCT-116, 120 nM for MiAPaCa-2 and 710 nM for A-549 cells.
The effect correlated with a pronounced lengthening of the cells' doubling time (Figure 2).
To investigate cell cycle redistribution by RPR-130401, HCT-116, MiAPaCa-2 and A-549 cells were exposed for 5-days to 1 x IC50 or 10 x IC50 FTI (relative to the cell line of interest) and submitted or not to gamma-rays 24-h before harvest.
BrdUrd was incorporated at the end of treatment for S-phase cell labeling.
The three cell lines were not equally responsive to drug (Figure 3).
RPR-130401 induced accumulation of HCT-116 cells in G2-M phase, with a concentration-dependent increase in the ploidy number and a decline in the normodiploid G1- and S-phase content.
These observations correlate those made by other authors using Ras-mutated human pancreatic cells and L-744,832 or human lung cancer cells and FTI-2153.
MiAPaCa-2 cells showed a similar response at low (1 x IC50) drug concentration.
However, with this cell line both the G1 phase depletion and the increase in the ploidy number, were substantially less pronounced at high (10 x IC50) than at low (1 x IC50) drug concentration.
Finally, with the exception of the pre-mitotic arrest, the effect of RPR-130401 on cell cycle progression and ploidy change was comparatively minor in A-549 cells.
Irradiation promoted drug-induced effects.
Incidentally, flow cytometric analysis did not provide evidence of a significant amount of the sub-G1 DNA fragments expected from apoptosis.
Two methods were used to determine whether RPR-130401 resulted or not in an altered radiation survival.
For lengths of drug exposure in excess of 12-h (1- to 5-days), cells were trypsinized and plated following treatment to preclude artifacts due to cell multiplicity.
Short contact with drug (1-, 2-, 3- or 12-h) was performed in the most sensitive cell line only, i.e., in HCT-116 cells.
In that case, cells were plated prior to treatment and the data corrected for changes in cell multiplicity (see Materials and Methods) where necessary.
A total of 78 survival curves were generated and fitted to eq.
(2) (see Materials and Methods) for data analysis.
Irrespective of the method used, exposure of cells to RPR-130401 did not produce any significant modification of radiation sensitivity relative to controls, even with the largest drug concentration and the longest length of drug exposure (Figure 4).
Altered distribution of lamin B following exposure to the FTI was investigated in HCT-116, A-549 and MiaPaCa-2 cells.
Cells were exposed for 5-days to 1 x IC50 or 10 x IC50 RPR-103401, submitted or not to gamma-rays 24-h before harvest and lamin B was subsequently probed by immunofluorescence.
Typical results are shown in Figure 5.
Control cells (Figure 5A,5D &5G) showed a nuclear distribution of lamin B with localization to the nuclear lamina as indicated by a ring-like staining at the nuclear periphery.
During mitosis the lamin was either cytoplasmic (Figure 5D) or poorly detectable (Figure 5G &5H).
The pattern of lamin B distribution was markedly altered following incubation with RPR-130401, depending on the cell line.
For HCT-116 (Figure 5B,5C) and
A-549 cells (Figure 5E,5F), the lamin B staining was still nuclear with the characteristic ring-like structure but, in addition to giant nuclei typical of treated HCT-116 cells (Figure 5C), cell doublets with no proper separation of the daugther nuclei after telophase were observed (Figure 5F).
MiAPaCa-2 cells showed a different pattern in response to RPR-130401 (Figure 5H,5H').
With these cells, lamin B was not strictly confined in the nucleus as indicated by cytoplasmic patches (Figure 5H).
Examination of DAPI-stained nuclei confirmed the absence of DNA in these patches (Figure 5).
Lamin B figures were not appreciably modified by exposure to ionizing radiation; however, radiation induced the formation of micronuclei in relation to mitotic cell death (data not shown).
Some FTIs reportedly affect the actin cytoskeleton via the Rho (a Ras-related GTP-binding protein) pathway and Rho-B, an endosomal Rho protein involved in receptor trafficking, has recently been suggested as an important mediator of the antineoplastic potential of FTIs.
We therefore sought to investigate the effects of 50 nM or 500 nM RPR-130401 on the distribution of actin and tubulin networks in HCT-116-cells exposed to RPR-130401 and/or radiation.
Pictures obtained using rhodamine-phalloidin and immunofluorescent labeling of isothiocyanate-conjugated tubulin in control and treated cells, are shown in Figure 6.
L-739,749, another FTI, was earlier shown to induce rapid morphological reversion of rat fibroblasts (Rat1-ras) transformed with H-ras.
Such phenotypic reversion was not observed using RPR-130401 in HCT-116 cells.
Normal membrane ruffles, circumferential actin bundles and focal adhesions as seen in control HCT-116 cells (Figure 6A), were still present in cells incubated for as long as 5-days in the presence of RPR-130401 (Figure 6B).
The size of the nuclei and the number of giant cells grew in parallel in the presence of the drug, up to threefold relative to controls.
The stress fibers and the tubulin network were normal in these cells (Figure 6B &6D).
Examination of bisbenzimide-stained nuclei showed the absence of apoptotic bodies (Figure 6A' &6B'), and no vesicles were formed in the cytoplasm of treated cells.
Activation of Ha-ras gene expression in mouse NIH3T3 cells is known to result in genomic instability, identified from chromosome aberrations including acentric fragments, multicentric and double-minute chromosomes.
We therefore investigated the effects of 50 nM or 500 nM RPR-130401 on the ploidy and chromosome integrity in HCT-116-cells exposed to RPR-130401 and/or radiation.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of the chromosome score within individual metaphases of colcemid-treated cells after 1-day of contact with RPR-130401.
Control cells showed a near-diploid karyotype with a modal number of chromosomes of 45.
Excess ploidy increased with the drug concentration, the radiation dose and the length of drug exposure.
The mitotic index decreased during treatment (data not shown), thus confirming that the accumulation of HCT-116 cells was in the G2 phase.
However, no chromosome aberration was seen at this stage using FISH analysis with all human centromeres probes.
All chromosomes in the metaphases examined displayed one unique centromere, even in metaphases containing up to 200 chromosomes (data not shown).
                  Flow cytometry (Figure 3) and DAPI fluorescence of nuclei (Figure 5), did not provide evidence of a significant level of apoptosis in cells exposed to RPR-130401.
In some instances, however, the pictures obtained from immunofluorescence analysis of the lamin B status in cells exposed for 5-days to RPR-130401, suggested breakdown of nuclear lamina, and it has been shown recently that inhibition of protein prenylation may cause apoptotic cell death in pancreatic cells.
As lamin B cleavage into 46 kDa fragments is a hallmark of apoptosis, we performed a Western blot determination of lamin B in extracts from HCT-116, A-549 and MiAPaCa-2 cells exposed for 5-days to 10 x IC50 RPR-130401.
The results (Figure 8) unambiguously show complete absence of lamin B cleavage.
The main effects of RPR-130401 against the three K-Ras mutated cell lines used in this study were (i) a pronounced cytostatic effect, with an IC50 in the range 50-710 nM; (ii) accumulation of cells in G2 phase, with G1 and S phase depletion; (iii) induction of a large amount of hyperploid cells (HCT-116 and MiAPaCa-2) showing active S-phase DNA synthesis, together with some giant cells; (iv) profound alteration of the lamin B pattern, without cleavage of the protein; (v) no alteration of the microtubule and actin networks, even after prolonged incubation with a high drug concentration in the most sensitive cell line (500 nM, HCT-116 cells); (vi) strictly additive interaction with ionizing radiation with regard to cell kill, cell cycle redistribution and induction of hyperploidy.
Two alternative pathways should be taken into consideration in order to explain these observations, namely, inhibition of the farnesylation of p21Ras or related proteins from the Ras superfamily, or inhibition of the farnesylation of other proteins resulting in disruption of the mitotic apparatus or cytokinesis traverse.
These hypotheses are discussed below.
p21Ras activation in normal and tumor cells is mandatory to the transition from cell quiescence to proliferation.
However, it is generally agreed that inhibition of p21Ras farnesylation does not suppress mitogenic functions in Ras-transformed cells.
Moreover, it has recently been shown that growth inhibition by FTIs does not necessarily proceed from inhibition of p21Ras prenylation, and that various Ras-unrelated proteins may be important targets for FTI treatment.
Even though it results in an altered subcellular distribution of p21Ras, RPR-130401 is not able to block p21Ras geranylgeranylation in such a way that inhibition of p21Ras farnesylation is not likely to account for the main effects of the drug.
On the other hand, the peptidomimetic FTI L-739,749 has been reported to prevent Ras-induced transformation through inhibition of Rho-B prenylation with a block in cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and major changes in stress fiber formation, cell shape and mobility.
None of these characteristic changes in cell morphology and architecture was observed upon prolonged exposure to RPR-130401 (Figure 6), which seems to rule out any member of the Rho family as a target for RPR-130401.
Considering the efficient pre-mitotic block and hyperploidy induced by RPR-130401, as also found with other FTIs, it is tempting to postulate that the target of the drug is a protein involved at some stage in mitosis and/or cytokinesis, and whose farnesylation is required for proper activation.
Indeed, protein isoprenylation is important at the G2/M transition in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and nuclear lamins are major targets for FTase.
Lamin B farnesylation, which is a very sensitive target for RPR-130401 in vitro, appears to deserve consideration as a candidate to this role.
As a matter of fact, among the three major type A-C lamins, lamin A and lamin B are initially translated with a CAAX motif.
This motif is cleaved upon post-translational maturation of lamin A but persists in lamin B, unless the C-terminal aminoacid residue is mutated.
Studies with mutant lamin deleted of the CAAX sequence have shown that the CAAX motif is essential to anchoring lamin B to the nuclear envelope; moreover, farnesylation is required for the integration of newly synthesized lamins into the pre-existing nuclear lamina during interphase, and GGTase is unable to substitute for FTase at this stage.
These data altogether suggest that inhibition of lamin B farnesylation could be an important target of RPR-130401, resulting in an aberrant onset of mitosis and cytokinesis and ensuing hyperploid cell generation.
Strong support to this scheme is given by immunofluorescence experiments showing that the intranuclear distribution of lamin B is profoundly altered in cells exposed to RPR-130401 (Figure 5).
This occurred without lamin B breakdown (Figure 8), consistent with lack of a significant level of apoptosis in the three cell lines used.
Interestingly SCH-66336, another FTI, reportedly allows accumulation of unfarnesylated prelamin A in patients under phase I investigation and in several cell lines in culture as well.
It has also been shown that SCH-66336 induces diruption of microtubule binding to the centromeric proteins CENP-E and CENP-F, thus evoking again faulty mitosis as an important outcome of FTI exposure.
Oncogenic Ras expression has been reported to have different outcomes in rodent and human cells with regard to radiation susceptibility.
Studies in mouse or rat cells relied on transfection with N-Ras, H-Ras or co-transfection with H-Ras and myc,.
Except in one study, the authors have conclusively shown that transformation of rodent cells with the Ras oncogenes results in enhanced radiation resistance.
Co-transfection with H-Ras and myc was found to act synergistically with regard to induction of the radioresistant phenotype, possibly in relation to inhibition of myc-dependent apoptosis.
With two exceptions in support of increased radioresistance, early studies on human cells did not show any clear-cut relationship between radiation sensitivity and expression of oncogenic Ras.
In addition, a study involving a cohort of patients with stage II and III carcinoma of the uterine cervix, demonstrated the absence of a significant correlation between rearrangements or structure of the Ha-ras-1 and/or c-myc genes and tumor response to radiotherapy.
However, the contribution of N- or K-Ras activation to intrinsic radioresistance in human cells has recently been adressed directly, i.e., without the perturbations introduced by cell transformation.
The mechanisms involved in Ras-related radioresistance are still open to question, but it might reasonably be proposed that it proceeds from constitutive activation of pathways dowstream from Ras in signal transduction, such as raf-1 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.
Whether and how FTase inhibition may affect the response of cells to ionizing radiation has also been a long-standing problem.
The outcome appears to depend very much on the cell line and the specificity of the FTI used.
The FTase inhibitor FTI-277 reportedly acted as a radiosensitizer in H-Ras-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts and in human tumor cells harboring H-Ras mutation.
On the other hand, the radiation susceptibility of human tumor cells expressing the wild-type form of Ras was not altered by FTIs.
However, enhanced radiation response by FTI-277 has been described in human cells expressing wild-type Ras together with the 24-kDa isoform (FGF2) of basic fibroblast growth factor, a factor involved in acquired radioresistance.
This was taken as an indication that farnesylated proteins other than Ras might be involved in the modulation of radiation response by FTI-277.
Weak radiosensitization only was obtained with FTI-277 in K-Ras mutants, unless FTI-277 was combined with GGTI-298 to hinder geranylgeranyl transfer to K-Ras.
Last but not least FTI-induced radiosensitization, when it occurs, seems to be independent on the growth inhibitory effect of the FTI.
We show here that RPR-130401 does not significantly alter the radiation susceptibility of human cells bearing K-Ras mutation.
This occurs in spite of significant hyperploidization, accumulation of cells in G2 and depletion of S phase.
Finally, impaired repair of radiation damage by RPR-130401, appears to be very unlikely to occur.
This seems valuable in the prospect of combining RPR-130401 as an adjuvant to conventional radiotherapy, as it should provide strictly additive interaction without the local and systemic adverse effects inherent in treatments with radiation sensitizers.
In this respect it is very exciting to note that two farnesyltransferase inhibitors, FTI-276 and L-744,832, have recently proven to act synergistically with ionizing radiation in vivo for growth inhibition of xenotransplanted H-Ras-mutated human tumor cells, without increase in acute or long-term radiation-induced damage to healthy tissues.
RPR-130401 was synthesized as described and stored at -20 C as a 20 mM stock solution in DMSO.
Prior to use, the solution was diluted first into medium containing 20% DMSO, then to the final concentration in culture medium.
DMSO was kept below 0.1% so as not to alter cell growth or radiation response.
Colcemid and all products from cell culture were from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France).
BrdUrd, propidium iodide, bisbenzimide, DAPI, Giemsa stain, TRITC-phalloidin and mouse anti-alpha-tubulin monoclonal antibody (clone DM1A) came from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France).
Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against lamin B was from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, California).
FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG was from Sanofi-Synthelabo (Paris, France).
Alexa  488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon).
Rat monoclonal antibody directed against BrdUrd was purchased from Harlan Sera-Lab (Loughborough, United Kingdom), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (heavy chain specific) was from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, Alabama).
Human centromere probes for FISH was obtained from QBiogene (Illkirch, France).
Solvents and chemicals were of the highest purity available and came from Merck Eurolab (Paris, France).
HCT-116 human colon carcinoma (ATCC CCL-247), MiAPaCa-2 human pancreatic carcinoma (ATCC CRL-1420) and A-549 human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC CCL-185) were grown as monolayers in DMEM (HCT-116, MiAPaCa-2) or RPMI-1640 (A-549 cells) containing sodium pyruvate and Glutamax I, and supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.
Cells were routinely subcultured after trypsinization at a density of 6,000 cells/cm2 in culture flasks every 5-days and incubated at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2 in air.
Less than 9-10 passages of the same primary subculture were allowed.
Prior to seeding, cells were rinsed twice with HBSS, harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment and counted in an hemocytometer.
Radiation survival with or without combined drug exposure was determined by clonogenic assays.
For determination of the response to radiation alone, cells from exponentially growing subcultures were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks at the suitable density, incubated for 3-h to allow cells to adhere and spread, and irradiated in culture medium at room temperature in an IBL-637 (137Cs) irradiator (CIS-Biointernational, Saclay, France) at a dose-rate of 0.92 Gy/min.
All experiments were performed in triplicate or more.
Two protocols were used in single or combined treatment assays.
For short lengths of drug exposure (<= 12-h), 1,000 cells were plated in triplicate in 25 cm2 flasks and incubated for 3-h. Cells were then exposed to drug for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 12-h, irradiated and returned to the incubator for 1-h in the presence of RPR-130401, followed by two washes with HBSS and feeding with drug-free medium.
Colonies were allowed to grow for 8-11 days, then fixed with methanol, stained with Giemsa and scored.
Small colonies (< 30-50 cells) were disregarded.
Results were corrected for cell multiplicity (see below).
Where the length of drug exposure was in excess of 12-h, cells were plated after treatments to avoid biases due to the formation of microcolonies.
Typically, cells were plated in 25 cm2 flasks and exposed to drug for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-days, and irradiated.
Seeding was adjusted so as to obtain an equal number of cells at the time of irradiation, taking into consideration the cytostatic effect of the FTI and the length of drug exposure.
Each flask was trypsinized immediately after irradiation, the cells were counted and 1,000 cells per flask were replated in drug-free medium for colony formation assays.
Cell cycle progression was monitored by dual parameter flow cytometry using a FACStar PLUS cytofluorometer (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France).
Cells were grown for 3- to 6-days with or without RPR-130401.
At that time, flasks were irradiated to 3.5 Gy (HCT-116), 5 Gy (A-549) or 5.5 Gy (MiAPaCa-2) and allowed to rest in the incubator for 24-h prior to fixation.
15-min before harvesting, cells were incubated with BrdUrd (10 muM) for pulse-labeling of S-phase cells, then collected, washed once with cold PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol.
Treatment of fixed cells for cytofluorimetric analysis, data acquisition and processing were done according to Demarcq et al.. Cell cycle analysis was performed with ProCyt software (CEA-INSERM, Grenoble, France).
Alternatively, HCT-116 treated cells were incubated with 0.2 mug/ml colcemid for 1-h, washed twice with HBSS and allowed to swell for 30-min in 75 mM KCl hypotonic solution.
Cells were then fixed in 3:1 v/v methanol:acid acetic in ice and washed threefold in the same solvent.
Fixed cells were dropped onto glass slides to spread chromosomes, and air dried.
Slides were stained with Giemsa before scoring.
For immunofluorescence characterization, cells were grown on 20 x 20 mm coverslips in medium containing 10% foetal calf serum for 3- to 6-days with or without RPR-130401.
At that time, the coverslips were irradiated to 3.5 Gy (HCT-116),
5 Gy (A-549) or 5.5 Gy (MiAPaCa-2) and allowed to rest in the incubator for 24-h prior to fixation.
To visualize polymerized actin and tubulin, cells were processed according to Mies et al..
Briefly, cells were fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1-min, followed by 10-min in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde and extensive washing.
The coverslips were then incubated (30-min, 37 C) with 0.2 mug/ml TRITC-labeled phalloidin, or with a 1:200 working dilution of monoclonal anti-alpha tubulin antibody followed by a 30-min incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG at 37 C.
To visualize lamin, cells were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1, v/v) for 20-min at -20 C, allowed to air dry, then washed 3 times with PBS and treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5-min at 4 C to permeabilize cells.
The coverslips were incubated (30-min, 37 C) with 5 mug/ml of monoclonal anti-lamin B antibody followed by a 30-min incubation with 1:500 Alexa  488 goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate.
To visualize nuclei, the cells were counter-stained with bisbenzimide (0.2 mug/ml) or DAPI (0.12 mug/ml).
Cells were viewed on a Zeiss microscope and photographed with Ilford HP-5 film.
For determination of lamin B cleavage, HCT-116, A-549 and MiAPaCa-2 cells were exposed for 5-days at 10 x IC50 each of RPR-130401.
At the end of treatment, cells were harvested in PBS with 2 mM EDTA and lysed for 20-min on ice with gentle agitation in PHEM buffer (80 mM PIPES, 80 mM HEPES, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 10 mug/ml aprotinin and 1 mug/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin.
The insoluble fraction, containing lamin B, was recovered by centrifugation, solubilized in Laemmli buffer (3% lauryl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and titrated.
An aliquot (20 mug total protein) of each extract was loaded onto 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany).
The membrane was saturated with bovine serum albumine and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against lamin B. Protein detection was carried out using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France).
Quantification was performed by densitometry with the aid of QuantityOne  software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California).
Care was taken to avoid contamination of seed cell suspensions by clusters, as their presence introduces large, systematic errors in viability measurements with clonogenic assays.
For this reason, the cellular multiplicity, i.e., the number of cells per potential colony-forming unit was carefully checked by microscope observation at the time of irradiation throughout the whole study.
When the average multiplicity was less than 1.1 (for 1- and 2-h drug exposure), no correction was applied.
Corrections were necessary for longer lengths of drug exposure (>= 3-h), because viable colony-forming units contained a substantial amount of doublets and quadruplets at these times.
In that case, the equation:
(where Sexp is the experimental cell survival determined from bulk colony scoring and an the fraction of colony-forming units with n viable cells) was used in order to calculate the single-cell surviving fraction (SCSF).
Radiation survival curves with or without co-treatment with RPR-130401 were drawn for best fit to a linear-quadratic equation, as usual:
where S0 is the clonogenic efficiency, S the residual survival, D the radiation dose, and alpha and beta numerical parameters characterizing the radiosensitivity of the cell line.
Equation (1) was solved with the aid of a home-made program.
Least-squares regressions were performed on a Macintosh microcomputer using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, Pennsylvania).

Background
Proteorhodopsin (pR) is a light-activated proton pump homologous to bacteriorhodopsin and recently discovered in oceanic gamma-proteobacteria.
One perplexing difference between these two proteins is the absence in pR of homologues of bR residues Glu-194 and Glu-204.
These two residues, along with Arg-82, have been implicated in light-activated fast H+ release to the extracellular medium in bR. It is therefore uncertain that pR carries out its physiological activity using a mechanism that is completely homologous to that of bR.
Results
A pR purification procedure is described that utilizes Phenylsepharose  and hydroxylapatite columns and yields 85% (w/w) purity.
Through SDS-PAGE of the pure protein, the molecular weight of E.-coli-produced pR was determined to be 36,000, approximately 9,000 more than the 27,000 predicted by the DNA sequence.
Post-translational modification of one or more of the cysteine residues accounts for 5 kDa of the weight difference as measured on a cys-less pR mutant.
At pH 9.5 and in the presence of octylglucoside and diheptanoylphosphotidylcholine, flash photolysis results in fast H+ release and a 400-nm absorbing (M-like) photoproduct.
Both of these occur with a similar rise time (4-10 mus) as reported for monomeric bR in detergent.
Conclusions
The presence of fast H+ release in pR indicates that either different groups are responsible for fast H+ release in pR and bR (i.e. that the H+ release group is not highly conserved); or, that the H+ release group is conserved and is therefore likely Arg-94 itself in pR (and Arg-82 in bR, correspondingly).
Proteorhodopsin is a 249-amino acid membrane protein native to several uncultured species of gamma-proteobacteria, which are a component of marine plankton.
Addition of retinal to E. coli expressing pR was shown to cause a reddish coloration of the bacteria with an absorption maximum near 520 nm.
The pR contained in the bacterial membranes was shown to act as a light-activated proton pump, but only when retinal is present.
Time-resolved UV/vis studies at pH 8 also revealed that the protein undergoes a photocycle, similar to that of wild type bacteriorhodopsin, but with a predominance of the O intermediate instead of M.
The bR photocycle has been characterized by spectroscopic methods as having six principal photointermediates: bR, K, L, M, N and O. Each intermediate has a distinct absorbance maximum; the most studied are bR (570 nm), M (412 nm), and O (640 nm) since these are the ones that can be produced in the highest concentration at physiological pH values.
Monitoring of the absorbance at individual wavelengths after photoexcitation is used to determine the relative concentrations and decay times of each of these photointermediates.
The L   M transition in bR is characterized by the deprotonation of the Schiff base to Asp-85, producing the distinctive 412 nm absorbance maximum of M, and by so-called fast proton release, the ejection of a proton from a different (unknown) residue into the external medium on the ~10-100 mus time scale, depending on pH. Reprotonation of the Schiff base from Asp-96 occurs during the M   N transition with an absorbance maximum of 560 nm.
The N   O transition involves the reprotonation of the Asp-96 from the cytoplasmic space.
Like bR, pR consists of seven transmembrane alpha-helices that include in the membrane interior all of the residues conserved among archaeal rhodopsin proton pumps.
In particular, analogues of Asp-85, Asp96, Arg-82, and Lys-216 of bR are present in pR. Conspicuously absent are analogues for Glu-194 and Glu-204 of bR.
The latter, as well as Arg-82, have been implicated in fast proton release.
In particular, mutagenesis of Glu-194 or Glu-204 in bR results in loss of fast proton release.
The absence of homologs for these residues in pR leaves open the question of whether it carries out fast H+ release.
Experiments described here demonstrate that pR does indeed undergo fast H+ release, at least under elevated pH conditions that resemble somewhat those of the gamma-proteobacteria's native open ocean environment.
We also demonstrate that there is a post-translational modification of at least one of the three native cysteines when pR is expressed in E. coli.
Both of these discoveries were made possible through purification methods for pR described herein.
PR was obtained in 85% purity, assuming that values of epsilon280 and epsilon546 for pR are the same as for bR solubilized in DMPC/cholate/SDS mixtures at pH 8 (epsilon280= 7.85 x 104 cm-1 M-1 and epsilon551 = 4.8 x 104 cm-1 M-1).
This assumption is actually expected to underestimate the purity of pR produced, by up to ~20%, since the pR we expressed has 10 tryptophan and 14 tyrosine residues, as compared to 8 tryptophans and 11 tyrosines in bR from H. salinarum.
The absorbance of contaminant proteins was assumed to be 1.1 for a 1 mg/mL solution.
By using these assumptions, the relative concentrations of pR and other proteins can be determined from the absorbance spectra of the various fractions (fig. 1).
The resulting purity values correlate well with those Coomasie-stained SDS-PAGE gels (see below).
The OG extract of cholate-washed membrane pellets starts out at a pR content of 7% total protein (w/w).
The Phenylsepharose column increases the purity level to 24%, with approximately 5% loss.
The final purification step by hydroxylapatite column chromatography produces pR with ~85% purity and a further loss of ~60%, i.e. the overall yield of the two column procedure was ~30%.
Relative to protein standards, the apparent molecular weight of bR is 25,000 while the apparent molecular weights of pR-wt and pR-TCM are 36,000 and 31,000, respectively (fig. 2, lanes E and C, respectively).
SDS-PAGE (fig. 2) also confirms the estimates of purity level based on the assumed epsilon280/epsilon546 ratio identical with that of detergent solubilized bR. Interestingly, the pR appears to be a doublet band whose relative concentrations remain almost unchanged during purification.
This doublet is also present in the less-purified sample of pR-TCM, with both bands shifted down by approximately the same amount (fig. 2, lane C).
Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis of pR samples that had been stored for periods of time up to several months indicate that after sitting for several weeks in octylglucoside solution at 4 C, the largest post-translational modification on wild-type pR is eliminated - presumably hydrolysed off of the cysteine(s) - leaving only a 31,000-MW band indistinguishable from that seen for pR-TCM (data not shown).
Furthermore, after boiling for several min in gel loading solution, this cleaved wild-type protein, as well as the TCM, both give an extra artifactual band near 36,000 dalton.
The latter band, a singlet, is coincidentally at almost the same apparent MW as the doublet from the uncleaved post-translationally-modified wild type pR (fig. 2, lane E).
These potential artifacts should be taken into consideration in any attempt to reproduce the results in Fig.
2.
Photocycle kinetics were measured at 400, 500.
and 580 nm in the presence of the short-chain lipid DHPC.
This lipid does not support the formation of closed bilayer vesicles, but rather forms micelles like a detergent.
The time-resolved measurements showed no positive 400-nm absorbance signals at pH 8.0 or lower (Fig. 3).
This is somewhat in disagreement with Beja et al, who detected small 400-nm transient absorbance increases upon photolysis at pH 8.0.
However, we observed a transient 400-nm absorbance increase at an elevated pH of 9.5 (fig. 3).
At pH 9.5 in the presence of DHPC, and observing transient changes at 500 nm (fig. 4), pR undergoes a 2-phase decay after the initial unresolved absorbance decrease.
Multiexponential fits show that the first decay phase has a time constant of 4 mus, in good agreement with the 4-mus rise time of the 400 nm signal (Fig. 4).
The amplitude of this decay represents about 80% of the initial absorbance depletion.
The second phase of the 500 nm absorbance decay occurs with a substantially slower time constant of 0.5 s, returning the remaining 20% of initial absorbance change.
The slowest decay components of the positive 400-nm signal and the negative 500-nm signal follow similar kinetics, although the amplitudes of these components differ by a factor of 3.
At pH 9.5, the 580 nm trace has no significant positive values indicative of an O-like intermediate, although, in agreement with earlier measurements, at lower pH values a red-shifted transient is the predominant positive absorbance signal (data not shown).
Figure 5 shows a different type of time-resolved measurement, probing not the pR chromophore, but rather pH changes in the protein environment.
Proton concentration changes in the aqueous bulk phase were measured with the pH sensitive dye cresol red, which has a pKa of 8.2-8.5.
The bottom trace in Figure 5 shows the absorbance change of the indicator during the pR photocycle.
The negative signal is indicative of a pH decrease, corresponding to transient H+ release from the protein into the solution.
The best-fit time constant for the release phase is 6 mus.
The positive 400 nm trace in fig. 5 (reproduced from fig. 3) shows that the proton release and uptake follow kinetics very similar to the apparent formation and decay of M, as is typically seen in bR near neutral pH. However, no proton release signal could be observed for pR at pH 6 or 8 (data not shown).
Meaningful comparison of intrinsic physiological properties of pR and bR depends on the purification of pR.
The E. coli expression system can easily be used to prepare pR at 85% purity with similar or less effort and time than required for bR (purple membrane) production from S9 H. salinarum.
The initial purity level of the OG-solubilized cholate-extracted membrane is about 7% pR by weight.
Phenylsepharose  column chromatography separates proteins on the basis of hydrophobicity, and has been used previously in hR purification.
As an initial purification step, the Phenylsepharose  column achieved a substantial increase in protein purity to 25%, along with removal of most of the lipid.
The final purification step, utilizing a hydroxylapatite column, has been previously used with rhodopsin.
This column proved to be more efficient as a final step in the purification than as a preliminary one, because large amounts of contaminant protein tended to slow the flow rate drastically.
This step of the purification yielded an increase in protein purity to >85%.
The overall yield of pR from membrane through the column purifications is ~30%.
Most of this loss, ~65%, occurs during the hydroxylapatite column.
Beja et al. reported a molecular weight for wild type pR of 27 kDa based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein.
Its 249 amino acids barely exceed the 248 of mature bR, which has a molecular weight of 26,000.
However, we observed a significantly higher apparent molecular weight (~36,000) for wild type pR on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, lanes D and E).
Post-translational modification of pR must almost certainly account for some of the observed molecular weight difference between pR and bR. Lipids or sugars covalently bound to the protein surface would not be removed during the purification procedure and could cause a higher apparent molecular weight.
Cysteines are frequently a site of lipid association with membrane proteins, (e.g. mammalian rhodopsin, which has two palmitoyl molecules attached to cysteine residues).
Therefore we compared the SDS-PAGE gel mobility of wild-type pR to that of a cys-less mutant (pR-TCM).
The elimination of the three possible sulfhydryl attachment sites lowers the apparent molecular weight of the pR-TCM by 5,000 (Fig. 2, lane C).
From this, we conclude that at least one of the three cysteines in pR is probably modified post-translationally.
However, this by itself does not account fully for the anomalous mobility of pR on SDS-PAGE gels, because pR-TCM is still approximately 5,000 higher in molecular weight than bR according to SDS-PAGE (fig. 2, lanes A & C).
Only ~2,600 of this can be accounted for by the V5 eiptope and poly-histidine tail that are appended to the C-terminus of pR by the pBAD-TOPO expression vector that we used.
There is undoubtedly a further post-translational modification of unknown nature.
Beja et al. reported an absorbance maximum for pR of 520 nm in E. coli membranes, using a difference bleaching technique to remove interfering absorbance bands from other membrane components in the impure pR sample.
We confirmed this result using crude E. coli membranes without detergent present (data not shown).
However, we observed an absorbance maximum of 546 +- 5 nm for pR in OG at pH 7 at all stages of purification (Fig. 1).
Small blue shifts were observed for pR samples in OG when measured at pH 8 and 9.5 (8 and 16 nm, respectively; data not shown).
For the pR samples reconstituted in DHPC, which were used for flash photolysis experiments, the absorbance maxima were similar to those measured in OG (spectra not shown).
A chromophore absorption maximum near 540 nm was also obtained by using difference spectroscopy of pR in crude E. coli membranes solubilized in OG (spectrum not shown).
However, for pR measured directly in crude E. coli membranes, i.e. not solubilized in OG, we obtained the same value (520 nm) as reported previously.
Solubilization in detergent presumably leads to structural distortions of the native protein conformation, and therefore a change in the absorbance properties of the chromophore.
However, the direction that lambdamax for pR would have to shift upon solubilization in OG is inconsistent with the pattern for bR, whose lambdamax decreases when it is solubilized in OG.
Furthermore, pR in OG showed resonance Raman spectra (D. Dunmire, R. A. Krebs and M. S. Braiman, unpublished data) indicative of a chromophore structure very close to native light-adapted (i.e. all-trans) bR in purple membrane.
However, there is one major difference: pR in OG exhibits an upshifted, doublet C=N Schiff base band consisting of two components of nearly-equal intensity.
These appear to correspond to the presence of two distinct subpopulations of pR, at least when expressed in E. coli and solubilized in OG micelles.
The different values of lambdamax for pR in membrane state and OG solution might be related to the presence of these multiple subpopulations, but this connection remains unclear.
Of the six principal photointermediates present in bR, four can be discerned from the time-dependent visible absorbance traces from pR in fig.
4, along with previously published time traces at 600 nm: the resting state (pR), M, N and O. The resting state, with an absorbance maximum of 546
nm (see above), provides the baseline spectrum for the difference time courses reported.
The M intermediate of bR has an unprotonated Schiff base group, giving rise to a blue-shifted lambdamax (400 nm).
Likewise in pR, an increase in the 400 nm absorbance should indicate formation of a deprotonated Schiff base, and therefore the presence of an M-like intermediate.
Interpretation of the 500 nm time course trace is more complicated.
As in bR, it likely involves decay of M to N, as well as from N back to bR. The absorbance maximum of the N intermediate in bR is 560 nm, corresponding to a protonated Schiff base.
This is not very different from lambdamax for the resting state of pR (546 nm).
The likely spectral overlap between pR and its own postulated N photoproduct complicates the determination of amounts of each that are present.
The slow (~500 ms) decay observed in both the 400 nm and 500 nm time courses indicates an equilibrium between the M and N intermediates that remains until pR returns to its initial resting state.
Beja et al. reported a strong positive 580-nm transient absorbance increase in suspensions of membranes prepared from E. coli expressing pR.
This positive absorbance difference is indicative of O intermediate formation.
We looked for its presence in partially-purified samples reconstituted in DHPC in the pH range 6-11.
(Data are shown only at pH 9.5; see Fig. 4).
Our observations at pH 9.5 do not show any evidence of O intermediate formation (Fig. 4).
Only at lower pH values was a clear positive 580-nm absorption change observed (data not shown).
This is in agreement with results on bR, for which O formation is also enhanced at lower pH values, and becomes small or nearly unobservable in the alkaline range.
Deprotonation of the Schiff base linkage of the retinal and Lys-216 is dependent on its pKa which changes between photointermediate states.
The Schiff base readily undergoes deprotonation in the M intermediate.
However, no M intermediate formation occurs below a pH of ~9 (figure 3); instead the O intermediate predominates.
Predominance of O at lower pH values is also observed in bR. However, in bR the M intermediate is detectable at low and high pHs, but has a longer lifetime at higher pH due to a long-lived equilibrium between M and another intermediate, N. It seems likely that an N intermediate of pR is similarly in equilibrium with its M intermediate, based on the fact that the transient positive (400 nm) absorbance increase is smaller than the negative 500 nm bleach, and the time course at 500 nm shows a partial return to baseline on a timescale of ~50 mus.
The difference in pH dependence between the pR and bR photocycles can likely be attributed to differences in the microenvironment of the Schiff base, and is perhaps related to absence of Glu194/204 in pR.
These adaptive differences presumably optimize the proteins to operate at maximum efficiency in the niches that their respective organisms occupy.
In the case of the lambda-proteobacteria, which in the open ocean (pH 7.8-8.0) occupy a signficantly more alkaline environment than halobacteria, perhaps the proton-release group is simply not under any evolutionary pressure to be capable of deprotonating in the M state at neutral pH.
In this view, the principal role of E194 and E204 in bR may to modulate the pKa of the H+-release group in the M state to a value lower than the pH of the organism's external environment.
Under the same conditions where M is observed (pH 9.5 and in 1% DHPC), pR undergoes fast proton release during its photocycle (Fig. 5).
The pH indicator dye Cresol Red was used to detect pH changes in the bulk aqueous phase.
These turn out to be similar to those observed for bR in the pH range 5.5-10.
After photoexcitation, pR (like bR, presumably) ejects a H+ from a residue near its extracellular surface decreasing the pH of the solution.
When the N   O transition takes place in bR, H+ is taken up from the medium, raising the pH once again.
The H+ signals from pR measured with Cresol Red occur on a time scale similar to that assignable to M and N decay, returning to baseline about 1 s after photolysis.
There is a clear kinetic correlation between M (and/or N) intermediate formation and fast H+ release in pR.
The linkage between these two phenomena is further supported by the observation that neither a transient 400-nm absorbance increase, nor fast H+ release, is shown to occur at pH 8.0 and below.
Nor is either observed in the absence of a reconstituting lipid (DHPC in these experiments).
In bR, the ejected proton is thought to originate from a triad of amino acids, R82-E194-E204.
However, in pR a homolog of only one of these three residues (the arginine) is present.
This raises doubts about previous conclusions regarding the specific roles of these 3 residues in fast H+ proton release, in both pR and bR. In particular, the apparently obligatory roles of E204 and E194 in fast H+ release in bR are not matched in pR.
Therefore, even in bR it is less likely that these groups themselves change protonation state between bR and M to provide the H+ released to the bulk medium.
Instead, it now seems more likely that E204 and E194 merely help to lower the pKa of the H+ release group from above 8, the apparent value for pR, into the vicinity of 6 for bR. It also seems very unlikely that the specific structural configuration of 2 carboxylic acid groups and arginine in bR could be conserved in pR, even if, as suggested previously, other surface carboxylic acids in pR could substitute in some ways for the roles of E194 and E204 in bR.
The only way that the H+ release mechanism can be strongly conserved between bR and pR is if arginine itself serves as the principal donor group for fast H+ release in both, with nearby residues (such as E194 and E204) merely modulating the pKa of the arginine in the M intermediate.
However, it remains unclear how the pKa of Arg-82 in bR could be made sufficiently low in its M intermediate to serve as the H+ release group at pH values down to 6.0.
Alternatively, it is possible that the fast H+ release we observe from pR at pH 9.5 may differ from that in bR. One possibility is that in pR, the released proton could come directly from the chromophore counterion, Asp-97.
This would be consistent with a proposed mechanism for fast H+ release that has been observed above pH 10 in the bR mutant E194Q.
In this mutant, Asp-85 was detected by low-temperature infrared difference spectroscopy to be deprotonated only in the N intermediate, and not in M. It is not clear yet whether Asp-85 deprotonation in an N-like state could account for the proton-release kinetics of pR (Fig. 5), or whether the M intermediate itself might have a partially-deprotonated Asp-85.
The reason for the requirement of DHPC in M intermediate formation and fast proton release is unclear.
Delipidated bR in octylglucoside is fully capable of M formation and presumably proton release, although with altered kinetics.
The requirement for pR to be in lipid to show fast H+ release and M formation stems either from a protein/lipid interaction needed to establish a stable, active tertiary structure, or from the need for the phosphate group in DHPC to act as a proton release group.
The latter seems unlikely due to the DHPC molecule being zwitterionic at pH 9.5, with no proton on the trimethyl-modified nitrogen of the choline.
Hence, the DHPC most likely interacts with the protein to effect minor structural changes needed to place the active site residues in their functional configuration.
A comparison of the primary sequences of pR and bR at first glance seems as to preclude fast H+ release as part of the proton-pumping mechanism of pR due to the absence of residues analogous to Glu194 and Glu 204 of bR. However, fast H+ release is indeed observed in pR under conditions where an M intermediate is formed.
Glu194 and Glu 204 in bR play a role in fast H+ release that is apparently not required for the mechanism of the bR family of proton transporters.
It is therefore necessary to conclude that either the H+-release groups in pR and bR are non-homologous surface carboxylic acid residues (as suggested previously), or else that a conserved non-carboxylic acid residue, i.e. Arg82/94 or Asp85/97, is the H+-release group in pR.
The higher pH requirement for the M intermediate of pR presumably corresponds with adaptation to the more alkaline oceanic environment in which the gamma-proteobacteria are found.
The necessity of reconstituting pR with some lipid before it is capable of photocycling shows that the presence of lipids facilitates pR in assuming its fully active structure.
E.-coli-expressed pR has post-translational modifications, including ~4000 daltons of substituents at one or more of its three cysteines.
Such post-translational modifications might also play a role in explaining the different physiological properties of pR and bR.
Proteorhodopsin was expressed by E. coli strain UT5600 containing an additional plasmid encoding for the first-reported pR gene (accession #AF279106, obtained from the uncultured proteobacterium EBAC31A08 clone BAC) with an Ara promoter and ampicillin resistance (kindly provided by O. Beja).
Single colonies were selected and grown overnight in LB/amp media (200 ml, 37 C, 300 rpm).
This culture was then diluted 10x into several 500-ml cultures.
After a further 2 h incubation in the shaker bath, a stock solution of 20% L-arabinose was added, to give a final concentration of 0.2% L-arabinose.
This culture was then incubated for 4 h (37 C, 300 rpm).
The cells (~20 ml wet volume) were then collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm x 30 min) and washed 3x with 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.1 (buffer A).
The cells were then resuspended in buffer A and incubated at 4 C with 50 mug all-trans-retinal (added as a concentrated ethanol solution) for 3 h.
The cells were collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm x 30 min), then resuspended in 60 mL buffer A containing 0.3 mg/mL lysozyme, and stirred for 4 h at room temperature.
The cells were again collected by centrifugation (6000 rpm x 30 min), then lysed with 20 ml of 20% sodium cholate, pH 7.1 (30 min., 4 C).
The cells were centrifuged again (6000 rpm x 30 min), and the supernatants collected.
After extracting 3x more with the same cholate solution, the pooled supernatants were diluted 10x with buffer A and centrifuged at 180,000 g for 45 min to collect the membrane pellet.
This cholate-washed membrane pellet was then further extracted 3x with 3.0% beta-octyl-D-glucoside (OG) in buffer A (30 min, with stirring, 4 C).
The pooled supernatants, containing OG-solubilized pR (~15 mg), were then diluted 6x with buffer A.
The diluted OG-solubilized membrane extract (10 mg in 300 mL total volume of 0.5% OG) was loaded on a 25 x 1 cm column containing Phenylsepharose  (6 fast flow high sub; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
The column was eluted with a 0.5%-2.0% OG gradient in buffer A (300 mL total volume, 0.5 mL flow rate).
The pR eluted at an OG concentration of 1.5-2.0%.
Fractions having an A280/A546 ratio of 4.0 or lower were pooled (9.5 mg pR recovered in all) and concentrated using Vivaspin  20 concentrators having a 5000 MW cutoff (Vivascience, Westford, MA).
A portion of the Phenylsepharose -purified pR (1.5 mg) was diluted to an OG concentration of 0.5% with 0.5 M KCl, 100 mM acetate.
It was then loaded on a 10 cm x 1 cm hydroxylapatite (BioGel HTP, BioRad) column and eluted under pressure with a 0-600 mM phosphate gradient (200 mL total volume, flow rate 0.5 ml/min).
Fractions with an A280/A546 ratio of 2.5 or lower were pooled and concentrated for subsequent experiments (0.5 mg).
Methodology for the site-directed mutagenesis of pR is discussed in detail elsewhere (R. Parthasarathy, T. Caterino, R.A. Krebs, M.S. Braiman, manuscript in preparation).
The triple cysteine mutant (pR-TCM) has all three of its native cysteines (Cys-107, Cys-156, and Cys-175) replaced with serines, and was prepared using the same E. coli expression system and purification methods as the wild type.
A 12% discontinuous SDS/polyacrylamide gel was used for molecular weight and purity analysis.
Time-resolved UV/vis spectroscopy methods were as described previously.
A Phenylsepharose -purified pR sample was reconstituted into mixed micelles containing 1,2-diheptanoyl-SN-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), by adding a 1% solution of the short-chain lipid and then removing most of the detergent on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 1% DHPC in 100 mM NaCl.
Proton release and uptake in the aqueous bulk medium were detected from the pR-containing micelles suspended in 1% DHPC, 100 mM NaCl, with 45 muM Cresol Red pH indicator dye.
Flash-induced absorbance changes at 580 nm of samples with and without the Cresol Red were subtracted to determine the transient signals due to proton concentration changes.
Photoexcitations were performed with 10-ns laser pulses of 3-6 mJ at 500 nm.
The time courses in Figs.
3,4 are an average of 40 cycles with the exception of the Cresol Red experiments averaging 100 cycles (Fig. 5, bottom trace).

Background
Vacuolar type H+-ATPases play a critical role in the maintenance of vacuolar homeostasis in plant cells.
V-ATPases are also involved in plants' defense against environmental stress.
This research examined the expression and regulation of the catalytic subunit of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase in Arabidopsis thaliana and the effect of environmental stress on multiple transcripts generated by this gene.
Results
Evidence suggests that subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Genome blot analysis showed no indication of a second subunit A gene being present.
The single gene identified was shown by whole RNA blot analysis to be transcribed in all organs of the plant.
Subunit A was shown by sequencing the 3' end of multiple cDNA clones to exhibit multi site polyadenylation.
Four different poly (A) tail attachment sites were revealed.
Experiments were performed to determine the response of transcript levels for subunit A to environmental stress.
A PCR based strategy was devised to amplify the four different transcripts from the subunit A gene.
Conclusions
Amplification of cDNA generated from seedlings exposed to cold, salt stress, and etiolation showed that transcript levels for subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase in Arabidopsis were responsive to stress conditions.
Cold and salt stress resulted in a 2-4 fold increase in all four subunit A transcripts evaluated.
Etiolation resulted in a slight increase in transcript levels.
All four transcripts appeared to behave identically with respect to stress conditions tested with no significant differential regulation.
Vacuolar-type H+-ATPases are enzymes responsible for the energization of membranes and the acidification of compartments within the eukaryotic cell via the establishment of proton and electrochemical gradients at the expense of ATP.
The vacuolar type H+-ATPase in plants is a large multimeric enzyme complex whose function is to pump protons across a membrane via primary active transport.
Vacuolar type ATPases are homologs of the F-type ATP synthases and probably convert the free energy of hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate bond into rotational motion.
Vacuolar type H+-ATPases are critical for the maintenance of homeostasis in eukaryotic cells.
In plant cells V-ATPases are responsible for the deacidification of the cytosol and the energization of secondary transport processes across the tonoplast, as well as in the endocytotic and secretory pathways.
In addition, the vacuolar type ATPase is thought to be primarily responsible for the acidification and expansion of the large central vacuole.
In plants a critical event in growth and development is the maturation and expansion of the central vacuole.
Upon maturation, the vacuolar contents can comprise more than eighty percent of the total cell volume.
Primarily filled with water, the vacuole also is a repository for a wide variety of solutes fulfilling numerous important metabolic functions.
The influx of water and metabolites into the vacuole is dependent in part on the generation of a proton motive force across the tonoplast.
Vacuolar type H+-ATPases are large, multimeric enzyme complexes of 500-750 kDa consisting of 15 or more different proteins.
Structurally, they can be divided into integral (V0) and peripheral (V1) membrane sectors.
The peripheral membrane sector is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is composed of at least five different subunits including the catalytic subunit, subunit A. The V1 peripheral sector is further divided into a head group and stalk region.
The V0 integral sector is embedded in the membrane and consists of at least 4 different subunits.
Subunit A of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase is the catalytic subunit.
The subunit A protein is approximately 70 kDa in most organisms studied and is a hydrophilic peptide located in the head group of the V1 peripheral sector in three copies per holoenzyme.
This subunit contains a nucleotide binding motif and functions to bind and hydrolyze ATP.
In addition, subunit A contains a highly conserved cysteine residue located within the enzymes' catalytic center that may be involved in regulation of the holoenzyme.
Cloning, sequencing and characteristics of subunit A of the V-Type ATPase from Arabidopsis thaliana have been previously reported.
Small multigene families of V-ATPase subunit A are known to exist in flowering plants and algae.
The catalytic subunit exists as two distinct genes with highly conserved exons and intron boundaries in twelve species of plants.
In the flowering plant Daucus carota (carrot) evidence exists for two distinct isoforms for the catalytic subunit, one of which is tonoplast specific while the other is localized to the Golgi.
In addition, two distinct mRNAs have been isolated from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum).
Two subunit A mRNAs are expressed in the unicellular alga Acetabularia acetabulum.
Isoforms of other V-ATPase subunits are also known from plants including subunit B, the proteolipid subunit and subunits D and E.
What is lacking in our knowledge of vacuolar type ATPases is a sense of what purpose these multigene family proteins may serve in the cellular milieu and how they participate in the growth, development, and metabolism of higher plants.
It has been proposed that multigene families might be encoding functionally distinct isoforms of V-ATPase subunits.
These isoforms may be required to provide unique functions or regulatory constraints within the varied micro-compartments requiring V-ATPases.
In addition, different isoforms may be responsible for targeting to varied subcellular compartments.
Furthermore, it is possible that gene family members may behave in a differential manner with respect to environmental stress.
Three enzymes are primarily responsible for the maintenance of proton flux across the tonoplast in plants, the vacuolar H+-ATPase, the H+ pumping pyrophosphatase and the Na+/H+ antiporter.
All three enzymes have been implicated in allowing plants to cope with environmental stress conditions.
Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to evaluate the role vacuolar type ATPases play in allowing plants to cope with environmental stress.
These endeavors have primarily concentrated on salt and cold stress.
Cold tolerant Brassica napus, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, demonstrated an increase in both subunit A mRNA and protein in response to chilling at 2 C. This chilling also resulted in a concomitant increase in cell sap osmotic pressure and endogenous ABA accumulation.
These researchers indicated that Arabidopsis also was a cold tolerant plant which exhibited a similar response with respect to V-ATPase subunit A mRNA, however they provided no data.
In rice (Oryza sativa) chilling plants at 10 C resulted in a two fold increase in vacuolar type ATPase activity evaluated by in vitro assay of isolated membranes.
This study did not analyze changes in protein level in the isolated membranes in response to chilling.
Cold sensitive mung bean seedlings (Vigna radiata) subjected to chilling at 4 C for 48 hours contrastingly showed no increase in vacuolar type ATPase activity in isolated membranes.
In addition, these researchers found no change in the amount of V-ATPase protein levels in response to chilling.
The facultative CAM plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum displays a differential organ level response to salt stress while still engaged in C3 photosynthesis.
Subjecting plants to 400 mM NaCl resulted in an approximately two fold increase in the transcript levels of subunits A, B, and the proteolipid in roots prior to the shift to Crassulacean acid metabolism.
Fully expanded leaves exhibited an increase only for the proteolipid mRNA, an increase of approximately three fold over non salt stressed plants.
Cell suspension cultures when subjected to salt stress exhibited increase in activity of both P-Type and V-Type ATPases without concomitant increase in protein levels.
Transcript levels of subunit E of the V-ATPase in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum were recently shown to increase in leaves but not roots of salt stressed plants with a concomitant increase in protein levels in leaves.
On the other hand, subunit E in Hordeum vulgare showed no effect on mRNA level in response to salt stress.
The effects of salt stress on V-ATPases has also been investigated in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) suspension cells.
Subjecting NaCl adapted cells to salt stress resulted in an approximately four fold increase in both proton transport and ATP hydrolysis on isolated membranes compared to unadapted cells.
Remarkably this increase in overall V-ATPase activity coincided with an apparent reduction in the amount of enzyme on the tonoplast.
This apparently contradictory finding may be the result of physical changes in the enzyme itself or changes in the lipid environment.
Especially confounding is the finding that mRNA levels for subunit A increase two to four fold in response to the same levels of salt stress in tobacco suspension cells.
Experiments with tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) showed similar results with respect to induction of mRNA for subunit A with an approximately two to four fold increase seen with respect to salt stress.
Recent work in the resurrection plant Tortula ruralis indicated that transcript levels of the proteolipid (subunit c) increased in response to salt stress but that there was no corresponding increase in protein levels.
The limited work done to evaluate the role of V-ATPases in drought stress has provided conflicting results.
Drought stress in winter Brassica napus resulted in a very similar response as cold stress, that is a dramatic increase in subunit A mRNA.
However, drought stress in Lycopersicon esculentum resulted in no apparent increase in mRNA levels for subunit A.
None of the previously mentioned efforts into evaluating the role of vacuolar type ATPases in environmental stress acclimation take into account the fact that subunits A, B, and the proteolipid are most certainly present as small gene families in the plants studied.
Furthermore, it is possible that these gene family members may behave in a differential manner with respect to stress.
The only work published previously on V-ATPase subunit isoforms and stress is concerned with the proteolipid gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Three proteolipid genes were evaluated for their response to salt stress as well as etiolation.
All three genes exhibited an approximately two fold increase in mRNA levels in response to salt stress (50 mM).
However, with respect to etiolation two isoforms showed no response while the third demonstrated an increase in mRNA levels.
A number of genes in plants have been found to contain multiple poly (A) attachment sites yielding different transcripts from a single gene.
Several examples have recently emerged where differentially polyadenylated genes have transcripts that are post transcriptionally regulated based on sugar sensing.
In rice (Oryza sativa), two transcripts generated off an alpha amylase gene exhibit differential stability based on sucrose availability.
A cell wall invertase gene (Incw-1) in Maize (Zea mays) is expressed as two transcripts differing in 3' ends.
The two transcripts are differentially expressed in response to sugars.
In this study we explore the possibility that differentially polyadenylated transcripts of the V-ATPase subunit A encoding gene show different responses with respect to etiolation, salt, or chilling stress.
A vacuolar type H+-ATPase subunit A cDNA has been previously identified and sequenced (GenBank accession number U65638).
The cDNA was identified as subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase via identity with other previously sequenced subunit A genes from other organisms.
The primary nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the A. thaliana subunit A cDNA showed a high degree of identity with subunit A cDNA sequenced from other organisms.
This cDNA encoded a putative open reading frame consistent with that of other subunit A genes and was shown to have all the motifs common to subunit A.
This high degree of conservation was evident across taxa as diverse as animals, plants, fungi, and protozoa.
Genome blot analysis was utilized to determine the number of genes in the A. thaliana genome corresponding to subunit A of the vacuolar type ATPase.
Genomic DNA was isolated as described, subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, and immobilized on a positively charged nylon membrane.
Ten single restriction enzyme digestions were performed.
Hybridization was conducted at moderate stringency with a 300 base pair homologous A. thaliana cDNA probe corresponding to subunit A of the vacuolar type ATPase.
Results indicated hybridization to only a single band for nine out of the ten enzymes (Fig. 1).
The HaeIII digest showed faint hybridization to a second band that was later shown to be the result of a HaeIII site located in the region of the probe (results not shown).
All evidences acquired to date failed to indicate the presence of a second V-ATPase subunit A gene in A. thaliana.
Whole genome blot analysis detected a single gene in the A. thaliana genome.
Extensive screening of a cDNA library derived from all organs and multiple developmental stages of the plant revealed only a single subunit A cDNA.
A polymerase chain reaction based screen failed to detect an intron length polymorphism (results not shown) between two subunit A genes found to be present in other plants.
Lastly, extensive database searches of GenBank, the Arabidopsis EST database, and the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (TAIR, ) report only a single subunit A gene in the current version of the Arabidopsis genome (chromosome 1 BAC F9K20).
This situation of a single subunit A gene appears to be unusual in plants.
Admittedly only a small subset of plants has been examined in detail.
Of the species examined to date three have only a single subunit A gene detected, the alga Coleochaete scutata, sugar beet (Beta vulgarise, and A. thaliana.
Flowering plants shown to have at least two subunit A genes include oat (Avena sativa), carrot (Daucus carota), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), magnolia (Magnolia virginana), Hydrastis canadensis, Chenopodium rubrum, and clematis (Clematis liguisticfolio).
In addition, the unicellular alga Acetabularia acetabulum has two V-ATPase subunit A genes.
RNA blot analysis was performed to determine the organ level expression pattern of the subunit A gene.
Vacuolar type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes critical for the maintenance of homeostasis.
Therefore, it is expected that all living plant cells require V-ATPase function.
Since A. thaliana seemed to possess only a single gene for subunit A of the V-ATPase it was expected that this gene should be expressed in all organs tested.
Whole RNA was harvested from leaves, bolts, siliques, flowers, axenically grown seedlings, and axenically grown roots.
RNA was denatured with glyoxal, fractionated via agarose gel electrophoresis, and immobilized on a positively charged nylon membrane.
Hybridization was conducted at high stringency with a 1700 base pair homologous cDNA probe labeled with digoxigenin.
In agreement with our expectations, results indicated high levels of expression in all organs tested (Fig. 2) with slightly higher levels of subunit A mRNA present in seedlings.
This is most likely due to the fact that seedlings are the most rapidly growing and metabolizing stage of the plant tested.
Seedlings are undergoing dramatic and rapid vacuole biogenesis to allow for rapid growth at this stage of development and therefore would be expected to require a higher level of subunit A expression than other more terminally differentiated organs.
Roots, leaves, bolts, and flowers showed approximately equivalent amounts of signal with somewhat lower levels in siliques.
Most eukaryotic mRNAs are characterized by the presence of a poly (A) tail, a series of adenine residues post transcriptionally attached to the 3' untranslated region.
The primary function of the poly (A) tail is thought to be in message stability assisted by a series of poly (A) binding proteins.
In addition, the poly (A) tail in conjunction with the 5' cap may be required for efficient translation of plant mRNAs.
Subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase in A. thaliana was shown to exhibit multi site polyadenylation.
Sequencing the 3' ends of seven independent clones isolated from the PRL-2 cDNA library and one EST obtained through the Arabidopsis EST database revealed four different length transcripts produced from the single subunit A gene based on different poly (A) tail attachment sites (Fig. 3).
Multiple polyadenylation sites are fairly common in plant mRNAs but this phenomenon is rare in animal genes.
Since the A. thaliana V-ATPase subunit A gene produced at least four different transcripts (all producing the same protein) and is one of two flowering plants observed to date not to have a multigene family for this subunit, experiments were designed to determine if muiti site polyadenylation might be a mechanism for gene regulation in plants.
V-ATPase proteolipid isoforms were shown to exhibit differential transcript expression levels in response to environmental stresses.
This fact implies a possible role for these isoforms in allowing the plant to deal with stress.
Experiments were designed to determine if, in A. thaliana, differentially polyadenylated transcripts could be regulated in response to stress.
First, it was critical to confirm that subunit A transcript levels were at all responsive to environmental stress conditions.
Three environmental stresses were chosen including 100 mM NaCl, etiolation for four days, and chilling at 6 degrees for four days.
In all three situations axenic, seven-day-old seedlings grown on agar were evaluated.
Seven day old seedlings were chosen for their short growth time, limited space requirements, and ease in culturing.
In addition, the facts that they are rapidly growing and metabolizing, were shown to produce ample quantities of subunit A transcript, and possess several organs including roots, hypocotyls, and cotyledons made them an attractive choice for analysis.
Whole RNA blot analysis was used first to evaluate the overall response of subunit A to stress conditions.
RNA was extracted from stress treated seedlings and non-treated control plants.
Hybridization was performed as previously described.
Results indicated a subunit A transcript response to stress.
An approximate 2-4 fold increase in transcript level was detected in seedlings subjected to salt and chilling stress compared to control plants (Fig. 4).
Etiolated seedlings showed essentially equivalent amounts of subunit A transcript compared to controls.
Since etiolation results in rapid elongation of seedlings it was expected that there would be a concomitant increase in subunit A messenger RNA as seen with proteolipid subunit mRNA in A. thaliana and subunit A message levels in rapidly expanding cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers.
Equivalent loading of whole RNA was evaluated via spectrophotometry measuring absorption at 260 nm using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-3 spectrophotometer and by visual confirmation using non denaturing ethidium bromide stained agarose gel electrophoresis (results not shown).
Having established that overall subunit A transcript levels were responsive to environmental stress conditions an assay was designed to examine the response of the four individual lengthed transcripts to the same stress conditions.
The goal was to determine if any of the four were differentially expressed in response to stress.
A PCR based approach was taken to evaluate transcript levels for the four different subunit A mRNAs.
Primer pairs were designed (Table 1) that would only amplify one of the four transcripts.
This was accomplished by anchoring the downstream primer in the poly (A) tail.
The upstream primer was located in the coding region of the subunit A cDNA.
Anchoring the downstream primer in the poly (A) tail prevented that oligonucleotide from priming at any other site since 10 out of 18 nucleotides were T's at the 5' end.
The primer pairs were designed such that the four amplification products would differ in size by approximately 100 base pairs for ease of visualization on agarose gels and blots (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).
Primer pair T-11 and T-12 corresponds to transcript-1 and produce an amplification product of 579 base pairs.
Primer pair T-21 and T-22 corresponds to transcript-2 and amplify a band of 455 base pairs.
Primers T-31 and T-32 correspond to transcript-3 and amplify a 362 base pair product.
Lastly, primer pair T-41 and T-42 corresponds to transcript-4 and produce a 238 base pair amplification product.
The transcript-4 amplification product, which is the smallest and nested within the other three, acted as probe to detect all four transcripts.
This nesting was accomplished to avoid differences in signal during hybridization based on different probe lengths and labeling efficiency.
A control experiment was performed prior to the actual stress analysis to ensure that the primer pairs amplified the correct transcript only and that the transcript-4 probe would detect all four amplification products.
Whole RNA was extracted from seedlings and cDNA was generated using oligo dT as described in materials and methods.
Subunit A transcripts were amplified from the generated cDNA with the appropriate primer pairs and transferred to solid support.
Hybridization was performed at high stringency with the transcript-4 amplification product as probe.
The results of this experiment indicated that all four primer pairs amplified only a single band of the appropriate and expected size and that the transcript-4 probe adequately hybridized to all four amplification products (Fig. 5).
The differential expression of subunit A transcripts was evaluated in response to salt, cold stress, and etiolation.
Complementary DNA's were generated from seven-day-old seedlings subjected to individual stress conditions.
Transcripts 1-4 were evaluated via RT-PCR using transcript specific primers.
Amplification products were immobilized on solid support and hybridized with the transcript-4 amplification product.
The results of this experiment indicate that all four transcripts behaved identically with respect to individual stress conditions (Fig. 7).
All four transcripts showed approximately 2-4 fold increases in response to 100 mM sodium chloride stress compared to untreated controls.
Similarly, treatment of plants at six degrees for four days resulted in a similar increase in signal for all four transcripts.
Etiolation resulted in slightly higher message levels for transcripts -1, -2, and -3 compared to controls.
The lesser degree of increase for transcript-3 might be due to near saturation of the signal.
The latter might be due to the higher abundance of the transcript, or due to more efficient amplification of the transcript-3 primer set.
Transcript-4 seems to show slightly less signal than control plants but the autoradiograph is somewhat under developed.
These results are in agreement with the whole RNA stress blot analysis.
Apparent quantitative differences in upregulation between transcripts shown in (Fig. 7) might be due to differential amplification efficiency of the four different primer sets and do not necessarily represent true differential upregulation of the four transcripts.
The data can only be evaluated quantitatively between samples amplified with the same primer set.
In summation, no significant differential regulation of the four subunit A transcripts was detected in seedlings in response to the three stress conditions evaluated.
Evidence gathered to date indicates the presence of a single gene encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase in A. thaliana.
The search for additional subunit A genes was conducted using whole genome blot analysis, screening a lambda PRL-2 cDNA library, intron length polymorphism analysis, and extensive computer searches of the Arabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tag database, GenBank, and the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative.
Most flowering plants evaluated to date have a small multigene family encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase.
The small size of the A. thaliana genome may be indicative of a trend toward streamlining of DNA in this plant, which may have eliminated a redundant subunit A gene over evolutionary time.
Subunit A genes and subsequently proteins are highly conserved.
Therefore, it is not likely that a subunit A gene would have escaped the screen by having a low degree of nucleotide identity.
Vacuolar type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes probably needed in all living plant cells.
The single A. thaliana subunit A gene was shown by whole RNA blot analysis to be transcribed in all organs of the plant tested.
The organs analyzed included roots, leaves, bolts, siliques, and flowers.
In addition, relatively high levels of transcript were found in whole seedlings.
These results support the notion of a single subunit A gene in A. thaliana that is transcribed in all cells of the plant.
Numerous examples are present in the literature [see and references therein] of changes in transcript, protein, or activity levels of vacuolar type H+-ATPases in response to environmental stress.
These results indicate a potential role for the vacuolar type H+-ATPase in maintenance of homeostasis during times of environmental stress.
Whole RNA blot analysis performed on seedlings exposed to environmental stress conditions indicated that transcript levels of subunit A were responsive to salt and cold stress treatments.
Transcript levels were shown to increase approximately 2-4 fold in seedlings treated with cold and salt stress.
Etiolation did not produce as significant a change in transcript level as salt and cold stress.
The single vacuolar type H+-ATPase subunit A gene detected in A. thaliana can produce at least four different length transcripts by using different polyadenylation sites.
These transcripts differ only in their 3' untranslated region and produce identical proteins.
The presence of regulatory elements in the 3'end of the subunit A gene could be a potential mechanism by which this protein is post transcriptionally regulated.
However, the evidence gathered in this work indicates that the four different transcripts generated off the single subunit A gene are not significantly differentially regulated in response to salt, chilling, or etiolation in axenically grown seedlings.
Multi site polyadenylation does not appear to be a mechanism for posttranscriptional control of gene expression for subunit A of the vacuolar type H+-ATPase in A. thaliana for the stress conditions and developmental stage tested.
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia seeds were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Ohio State University, Columbus OH.
Seeds were germinated in 4-inch pots according to standard protocols.
Axenic seedlings, and soil grown plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 23 C under a 16-hour photoperiod until appropriate organs were mature.
Axenic seedling cultures were prepared by placing surface sterilized seeds on 90 mm germination plates containing 1% agar and 4.4 g/L MS salts with minimal organics (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO), pH 6.0.
Seedlings were harvested when 7 days old.
Axenic roots were obtained by plating surface sterilized seeds on Nunc square Bio-Assay dishes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).
Plates were allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood, sealed with paraflim and incubated vertically as above.
Roots were harvested 7-14 days later.
Growth effects of salt stress were evaluated by germinating surface sterilized seeds on agar containing various concentrations of sodium chloride.
The optimal concentration chosen to evaluate the effects of salt stress on V-ATPase subunit A transcript levels was 100 mM. Higher concentrations resulted in failure to germinate or extremely poor growth.
At 100 mM salt most seeds germinated but required more time to do so than controls.
Plantlets did grow but were less robust than non-treated controls (results not shown).
Seedlings were harvested after seven days of growth.
In the case of etiolation stress, surface sterilized seeds were germinated on agar for three days under light and temperature conditions described above.
After three days the plates were placed in a light sealed box at the same temperature conditions.
Seedlings were harvested four days later.
Plantlets exhibited the typical characteristics of etiolation, the hypocotyls were lengthened and the cotyledons reduced compared to light grown controls.
Cold stress was evaluated by germinating surface sterilized seeds as described for three days under normal light and temperature.
Agar plates containing seedlings were then transferred to a cold room at 6 C. Seedlings were maintained at this temperature for four days before being harvested.
Genomic DNA was extracted from mature leaves using a miniprep protocol modified by the addition of a CTAB extraction.
A. thaliana leaves were harvested, hand washed and then ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen.
Ground material was used immediately for DNA extraction or stored at -80 C. Post extraction samples were treated with RNAse A at 37 C for 15 minutes to remove contaminating RNA.
Organ specific whole RNA extraction was performed as described.
Specific organs were harvested and immediately ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen.
Special care was taken in the case of siliques and flowers to harvest the organs directly into liquid nitrogen to prevent degradation of the RNA.
Standard precautions were taken to eliminate ribonuclease contamination in solutions and glassware including baking all glassware at 200 C for six hours, and treating all solutions (except those containing Tris) with 0.1% diethylpyrocarbonate for 12 hours followed by autoclaving.
Nucleic acids were quantitated by spectrophotometry and via inspection of ethidium bromide stained agarose gels.
Genomic DNA (5-10 mug) was digested with restriction enzymes according to the manufacturers recommendations.
Digested DNA was size fractionated via gel electrophoresis in 12 cm gels containing 0.8% agarose run in IX TAE or TBE at 25 volts for 12 hours.
Fractionated DNA in gels was depurinated, denatured, and neutralized according to standard protocols.
DNA was transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond N+) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) by the wick transfer method using 20X SSC overnight.
Membranes were baked at 80 C for 1.5 hours.
Hybridization was performed according to a procedure from modified as described below.
Membranes were first washed for 5 minutes in 5X SSC at room temperature followed by 1 hour at 65 C in 1X SSC/0.1% SDS.
Membranes were then pre-wet for 10 minutes in wash buffer (20 mM Na2HPO4 pH-7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS).
Prehybridization was performed at 67 C for two hours in a seal-a-meal bag (Dazey Corporation, Industrial Airport, KS) with hybridization solution (0.25 M Na2HPO4 pH-7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 20% SDS with 0.5% blocking reagent-Boehringer Mannheim, Biochemical Products, Indianapolis IN) at a volume of 125 mul/sq. cm. of membrane and with formamide added to a final concentration of 25% and 15 mug/ml boiled salmon sperm DNA.
Hybridization was performed overnight at 67 C in a sealed bag with 125 mul/sq cm fresh hybridization solution containing formamide and salmon sperm DNA as above with the addition of 40 ng/ml digoxigenin labeled probe denatured by boiling for 5 minutes.
The probe utilized was a 300 base pair digoxigenin labeled PCR product.
Membranes were washed after hybridization four times at 65 C for 30 minutes each with vigorous agitation in wash buffer.
Membranes were then soaked for 10 minutes in maleate buffer (0.1 M maleic acid, 3 M NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, pH 8) at room temperature followed by blocking for two hours at room temperature in maleate buffer with 0.5% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim, Biochemical Products, Indianapolis IN).
Blocked membranes were sealed in a bag with 125 mul/sq. cm.
of maleate buffer with 0.5% blocking reagent to which
was added anti digoxigenin Fab fragment antibody (diluted 20,000:1) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Biochemical Products, Indianapolis IN).
After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature membranes were washed in maleate buffer four times for 15 minutes each at room temperature.
Next, membranes were soaked for 10 minutes in substrate buffer (100 mM TRIS, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2 pH 9.5) at room temperature.
Incubation was then performed for ten minutes at room temperature with CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate (Boehringer Mannheim, Biochemical Products, Indianapolis IN) diluted 1:100 in substrate buffer.
Membranes were then exposed to X-ray film.
RNA was fractionated via denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis using glyoxal according to standard protocols.
Immediately before use the glyoxal was deionized by vortexing in the presence of mixed bed resin beads (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO) until the pH was greater than 5.
Determination of pH was made using Hydrion pH sensitive paper (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).
Agarose gels (0.8%, 12 cm) cast in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer were run for 2 hours at 100 volts with the buffer recirculated by a peristaltic pump.
RNA gels were blotted using the same procedure as DNA gels omitting the depurination, denaturation, and neutralization steps.
In addition, hybridization and chemiluminescent immunodetection were also performed using the same protocol for genome blot analysis except for the following.
Just prior to prewetting in wash buffer for prehybridization RNA membranes were given two deglyoxylation washes in 20 mM Tris pH 8 for twenty minutes each at 65 C. The probe used for whole RNA blot analysis was a 1700 base pair PCR product.
Synthesis of cDNA was accomplished using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Bethesda, MA) and oligo dT according to the manufacturers instructions.
Whole RNA was diluted to a concentration of 0.67 mug/mul in a total volume of 10-15 mul.
The sample was heated at 90 C for 5 minutes and chilled on ice.
The reverse transcription reaction mixture included the following components in a total volume of 20 mul.
Nucleotides (dNTP's) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Forty units of a ribonuclease inhibitor (RNAsin) (Promega, Madison, WI) were added.
Denatured, whole RNA (2 mug) was added in a volume of 3 mul.
Oligo dT primer (1.1 mul) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 muM. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. Dilution buffer (5X concentration, provided by the manufacturer) was added to a final concentration of 1X. After all the components were assembled, 200 units of MMLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL Life Technologies, Bethesda, MA) were added.
The sample was incubated at 42 C for 1 hour followed by heat denaturation of the enzyme at 95 C for 10 minutes.
Samples were stored at -20 C.
In general, PCR reactions were performed in a volume of 50 mul with 50 picomoles of each primer, dNTP's (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM, 1 mul of template, 1X PCR buffer (10X PCR buffer contained 700 mM Tris pH 8.8, 20 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% Tween 20) and Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Inc., Wellesley MA) diluted to the manufacturers recommendations.
The reaction components were assembled except Taq polymerase and heated at 95 C for 5 minutes.
Polymerase was added and the PCR allowed to cycle for 1 minute at 94 C, 1 minute at 55 C and 1.5 minutes at 72 C for 30 cycles followed by 10 minutes at 72 C.
All digoxigenin labeled probes for non-radioactive detection were generated using the Polymerase Chain Reaction.
Probes were labeled using 10X PCR labeling mix (Boehringer Mannheim, Biochemical Products, Indianapolis IN) at a concentration of 1X replacing the normal dNTP mix.
In each case 1 mul of template was added to the reaction mix.
Template was created by amplifying a band off an Expressed Sequence Tag (EST G5B3T7) from the Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag database, fractionating the product on a low melting point agarose gel, and excising the band.
The excised, diluted band was re-amplified to ensure fidelity of the PCR.
After successful re-amplification the template was utilized for probe generation.
A 300 base pair cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotide residues 779-1078 of the A. thaliana vacuolar type H+-ATPase subunit A gene was generated using primers SM-2 and SM-3 (Table 1).
This probe was used for whole genome blot analysis.
An approximately 1700 base pair cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotide residues 274-1981 of subunit A was generated using primers VA-1 and VA-9.
This probe was used for multi organ RNA blot analysis and stress response northerns.
In both cases template was generated off EST G5B3T7.
Cycling parameters for both probes were identical to those described above.
Probes were precipitated by adding 1 mul of tRNA (10 mg/ml) or 1/50th volume of glycogen (10 mg/ml in sterile distilled water) to the PCR reaction followed by 1/10th volume of sterile 4 M lithium chloride.
Next, 3 volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol were added and the DNA precipitated for 30 minutes at -80 C. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 C for 15 minutes.
Pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol, air dried for 15 minutes and resuspended in 50 mul TE buffer/0.1 % SDS.
Probes were quantitated by fractionation of 1/10th volume in a 0.8% agarose gel compared to a known quantity of HindIII digested lambda DNA.
Probes were stored at -20 C until use.
Four different subunit A transcripts were amplified using RT-PCR.
Primer pairs were designed with one upstream coding region primer and one primer anchored in the poly (A) tail of the transcript.
In all four cases template was 1 mul of seedling cDNA.
Amplification reaction mixtures were assembled as described, with PCR buffer modified to contain only 1 mM magnesium chloride.
Transcript 1 was amplified using primers T-11 and T-12 (Table 1).
Transcript 2 was amplified using primers T-21 and T-22.
Transcript 3 was amplified using primers T-31 and T-32.
Transcript 4 was amplified using primers T-41 and T-42.
The PCR was allowed to proceed in each case for 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94 C, 1 minute at the annealing temperature, and 1 minute at 72 C. Primers amplifying transcripts 1 and 2 were annealed at 35 C, primers amplifying transcripts 3 and 4 were annealed at 40 C. Following 30 cycles, primer extensions were completed at 72 C for 10 minutes.
PCR products were then fractionated on 2.5% agarose gels.
The transcript 4 amplification product was used as template for the generation of a digoxigenin labeled probe for use in the subunit A transcript stress response experiment.
The transcript 4 amplification product was purified via low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis and used as template for probe generation.
The digoxigenin labeled probe was generated as described using the transcript 4 cycling parameters and primers T-41 and T-42.
DNA sequence of all PCR primers used in this research can be found in Table 1.
A diagrammatic representation of the PCR amplification products generated from transcript specific primers is shown in fig.

Introduction
Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal-recessive disease that affects neuro-immunological functions, associated with increased susceptibility to malignancy, chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.
Although ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) heterozygous deficiency has been proposed to increase susceptibility to breast cancer, some studies have not found excess risk.
In experimental animals, increased susceptibility to breast cancer is not observed in the Atm heterozygous deficient mice (Atm+/-) carrying a knockout null allele.
In order to determine the effect of Atm heterozygous deficiency on mammary tumourigenesis, we generated a series of Atm+/- mice on the p53+/- background with a certain predisposition to spontaneous development of mammary carcinomas, and we examined the development of the tumours after X-irradiation.

BALB/cHeA-p53+/- mice were crossed with MSM/Ms-Atm+/- mice, and females of the F1 progeny ([BALB/cHeA x MSM/Ms]F1) with four genotypes were used in the experiments.
The mice were exposed to X-rays (5 Gy; 0.5 Gy/min) at age 5 weeks.
Results
We tested the effect of haploinsufficiency of the Atm gene on mammary tumourigenesis after X-irradiation in the p53+/- mice of the BALB/cHeA x MSM/Ms background.
The singly heterozygous p53+/- mice subjected to X-irradiation developed mammary carcinomas at around 25 weeks of age, and the final incidence of mammary carcinomas at 39 weeks was 31% (19 out of 61).
The introduction of the heterozygous Atm knockout alleles into the background of the p53+/- genotype significantly increased the incidence of mammary carcinoma to 58% (32 out of 55) and increased the average number of mammary carcinomas per mouse.
However, introduction of Atm alleles did not change the latency of development of mammary carcinoma.
Conclusion
Our results indicate a strong enhancement in mammary carcinogenesis by Atm heterozygous deficiency in p53+/- mice.
Thus, doubly heterozygous mice represent a useful model system with which to analyze the interaction of heterozygous genotypes for p53, Atm and other genes, and their effects on mammary carcinogenesis.
Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal-recessive disease that affects neuro-immunologic functions, and is associated with increased susceptibility to malignancy, chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.
ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) heterozygous deficiency has been proposed to increase susceptibility to breast cancer.
However, those early studies were limited by the lack of reliable assays with which to identify carriers.
In fact, in a later study a lack of association of heterozygous ATM mutations with early onset of breast cancer was found.
More recent epidemiological studies suggested that missense mutation in the ATM gene, rather than a protein-truncating mutation, which accounts for the majority of mutations in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, confers increased risk for breast cancer.
Thus, cancer risk in ATM heterozygotes varies depending on the mutation type (i.e. some missense-type mutations are associated with early onset of breast carcinoma whereas truncation-type mutations are not).
Recently, epidemiological studies on excess risk for breast cancer in ATM heterozygosity were reported.
In experimental animals, no tumours were observed in Atm heterozygous mice carrying a knockout null allele of Atm .
In contrast, Atm knock-in heterozygous mice harbouring an in-frame deletion corresponding to the human mutation exhibit increased susceptibility to a wide variety of tumours.
Thus, data in humans and mice suggest that the type of Atm mutation determines susceptibility to cancer in heterozygous individuals.
Heterozygosity for a null knockout allele of Atm in mice and protein-truncating alleles of ATM in humans was thought not to increase susceptibility to mammary cancer.
On the other hand, haploinsufficiency at the Atm gene has a phenotype of increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in mice.
In contrast to the Atm gene, the p53 null allele exhibits haploinsufficiency for the development of tumours in mice, mainly lympho-haematopoietic malignancies.
The p53 heterozygotes of BALB/c genetic background develop mammary tumours.
Mice doubly null for the p53 and Atm genes were reported to exhibit a dramatic acceleration in tumour formation relative to singly null mice, indicating that the genes cooperate in a significant manner to prevent tumourigenesis.
However, the authors noted no mammary carcinoma in any of the four genotypes studied (p53+/+ Atm-/-, p53+/- Atm-/-, p53-/- Atm+/-, and p53-/- Atm-/-).
Thus, the significance of haploinsufficiency of the Atm null allele in mammary carcinogenesis is obscure at present.
In order to determine the effect of Atm heterozygous deficiency on mammary tumourigenesis, we generated a series of Atm+/- mice on the background of p53+/- mice with a certain predisposition to spontaneous development of mammary carcinomas, and we examined the development of tumours after X-irradiation.
Our results indicate a strong enhancement of mammary carcinogenesis in the Atm heterozygous deficient mice under the p53 heterozygous deficiency.
The p53 targeted allele generated by Donehower and coworkers was introduced into the BALB/cHeA mouse at The Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam).
The p53 heterozygous deficient mice (p53+/-) were repeatedly backcrossed to BALB/cHeA mice more than 30 times, and maintained at the animal facility of Osaka Prefecture University.
The Atm targeted mouse (129/SvEv-Atmtm1Awb/+ mouse) was originally generated in the Jackson Laboratory.
The Atm heterozygous deficient mice (Atm+/-) were repeatedly backcrossed more than 10 times to MSM/Ms mice.
The BALB/cHeA-p53+/- mice were crossed with MSM/Ms-Atm+/- mice, and females of the F1 progeny ([BALB/cHeA x MSM/Ms]F1) with four genotypes (i.e. p53+/- Atm+/-, p53+/- Atm+/+, p53+/+ Atm+/- and p53+/+ Atm+/+) were used in the experiments.
The conditions for breeding were described previously.
Mice were exposed at 5 weeks of age to X-rays (5 Gy; 260 kV, 12.0 mA, 0.3 mm Cu + 0.5 mm Al filter; 0.5 Gy/min) from an X-ray generator (Radioflex 350; Rigaku Industrial Co., Takatsuki, Japan).
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the standards relating to the care and management of experimental animals (Japan) and Osaka Prefecture University's guidelines for animal care and use.
Moribund mice were killed by cervical dislocation for autopsy.
In cases of thymic lymphoma, the enlarged thymuses were examined as previously described.
In tumour-bearing mice the tumours were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, processed histologically, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
The processed tumour specimens were evaluated by medical and veterinary pathologists using the Annapolis guidelines established by Cardiff and coworkers.
Normal and mammary carcinoma tissues were removed.
Isolation of DNA, PCR amplification, electrophoresis of PCR products and assessment of allelic losses were performed according to a procedure described previously.
Genotypes for the wild-type and targeted alleles of p53 and Atm genes were determined by analyzing the PCR products for these alleles.
Amplification for the p53 alleles was done as described elsewhere.
The wild-type and the targeted alleles of the p53 gene were amplified by PCR using primers p53-4F (5'-CGACCTCCGTTCTCTCTCCTCTCTT-3') and p53-6R (5'-AGACGCACAAACCAAAACAAAATTACA-3'), and primers p53-NF (5'-GCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACGAGT-3') and p53-6R, respectively.
Similarly, amplification of the wild-type and the targeted allele of the Atm gene were performed by using primers IMR0640F
(5'-GCTGCCATACTTGATCCATG-3')
and IMR0641R (5'-TCCGAATTTGCAGGAGTTG-3'), and primers IMR0640F and AtmNeo410R (5'-CGGTGGATGTGGAATGTGTG-3'), respectively.
Statistical significance was evaluated for the incidence of mammary carcinoma and number of carcinomas per mouse by chi2 analysis and Mann-Whitney U-test, respectively.
Comparison of latency in mammary carcinoma development was examined by unpaired Student's t-test.
Mammary carcinomas occurred in BALB/c mice of the p53+/- genotype, and tumours of similar macroscopic morphologies were also observed in the (BALB/c x MSM/Ms)F1-p53+/- mice.
The histological features of these tumours in the mammary glands are shown in Fig.
1a,1b,1c,1d,1e,1f, which indicates that they are adenocarcinomas.
The histopathology of the tumours in nonirradiated mice (Fig. 1a,1b) exhibited more hyperplastic lesions than did those in irradiated mice (Fig. 1c,1d,1e,1f), but basically there were no marked differences between the two groups.
There was also no remarkable difference in histopathological features between Atm+/- (Fig. 1c,1d) and Atm+/+ mice (Fig. 1e,1f) in the irradiated groups.
These tumours formed glands lined by highly pleomorphic cells exhibiting frequent mitosis, and were classified as glandular adenocarcinomas, high grade according to the Annapolis Pathology Classification.
Lymphomas (Fig. 1g), mainly thymic lymphomas, were efficiently induced by exposure to X-rays, regardless of p53 and Atm genotype, although only a few lymphomas were observed in nonirradiated mice.
Ovarian carcinomas, osteosarcomas (Fig. 1h) and hepatomas developed spontaneously.
Squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, histiocytic sarcomas and granulocytic leukaemias were also observed in irradiated mice.
Twenty-eight p53+/- Atm+/-, 22 p53+/- Atm+/+, 11 p53+/+ Atm+/- and 25 p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice were examined for spontaneous development of tumours until age 26 months (113 weeks).
Fourteen out of 28 p53+/- Atm+/- mice (50%) and seven out of 22 p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (32%) developed mammary carcinomas during the period of observation (Table 1, Fig. 2).
The incidence of mammary carcinomas in p53+/- Atm+/- mice appeared to be higher than that in p53+/- Atm+/+ mice, but the incidences did not differ significantly between Atm+/- and Atm+/+ genotypes (P = 0.32, by Fisher's exact probability test).
Among the tumours that developed in the p53+/- mice, mammary carcinoma were the most common.
These mammary carcinomas were mainly observed at 41-77 weeks after birth (Fig. 2).
No significant difference in latency in the nonirradiated groups was observed between doubly heterozygous mice and p53 singly heterozygous mice (P = 0.47, by unpaired Student's t-test).
None of 11 p53+/+ Atm+/- mice and 25 p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice developed mammary carcinomas.
Several lymphomas and a few other tumours developed in the four genotypes (Table 1).
Thus, mammary carcinoma development depended strongly on p53 heterozygous deficiency in (BALB/c x MSM/Ms)F1 mice, and p53+/- mice of both Atm+/+ and Atm+/- genotypes developed mammary carcinoma.
To test the effect of haploinsufficiency of the Atm gene on mammary carcinogenesis after X-irradiation in p53+/- mice, 55 p53+/- Atm+/-, 61 p53+/- Atm+/+, 47 p53+/+ Atm+/- and 53 p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice (for a total of 216 mice) were exposed to X-rays (5 Gy) at age 5 weeks.
Only one out of 53 p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice and none of 47 p53+/+ Atm+/- mice developed mammary carcinoma, indicating that almost all p53+/+ mice fail to develop mammary carcinomas, despite X-irradiation and irrespective of Atm gene status.
In contrast, 32 out of 55 p53+/- Atm+/- mice (58%) and 19 out of 61 p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (31%) developed mammary carcinomas (Table 2, Fig. 2).
The proportion of mice developing mammary carcinomas in the p53+/- Atm+/- group was significantly greater than that in the p53+/- Atm+/+ group (P = 0.0034, by chi2 test).
A total of 52 mammary carcinomas developed in 55 p53+/- Atm+/- mice (average number of mammary carcinomas/mouse = 0.95), whereas 28 mammary carcinoma developed in 61 p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (average number of mammary carcinomas/mouse = 0.46; Table 2).
The average number of mammary carcinomas per mouse in the p53+/- Atm+/- group was significantly greater than that in p53+/- Atm+/+ mice (P = 0.0052, by Mann-Whitney U-test).
Thus, Atm heterozygous deficiency enhanced development of mammary carcinoma in irradiated p53 heterozygous knockout mice.
Spring and coworkers observed no tumours in Atm knockout (Atm+/-) heterozygous mice.
Mice bearing a knockout allele of Atm and humans carrying a mutant allele of truncated type in the ATM gene have been shown not to have obviously elevated susceptibility to mammary carcinogenesis.
Our findings show that heterozygosity for a null knockout allele of Atm enhances mammary carcinogenesis under p53+/- status, although the Atm mutation is not a dominant-negative type.
Heterozygous deficiency of p53 might make clear the effect on mammary carcinogenesis of haploinsufficiency in the Atm gene.
These mammary carcinomas were observed significantly earlier (at 18-38 weeks after irradiation; i.e. 23-43 weeks of age) than in the nonirradiated group (age 41-75 weeks; Fig. 2).
In particular, mammary carcinomas frequently developed 23-28 weeks after irradiation.
The mean (+- standard deviation) latency periods were 32.6 +- 4.8 and 29.8 +- 3.6 weeks in p53+/- Atm+/- and p53+/- Atm+/+ mice, respectively.
Thus, X-irradiation at 5 Gy at age 5 weeks considerably shortened the latency period of mammary carcinoma development in these two groups with different genotypes.
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the incidences of mammary carcinoma in p53+/- Atm+/- mice were 58% (32 out of 55) and 50% (14 out of 28) in irradiated and nonirradiated groups, respectively; in p53+/- Atm+/+ mice the incidence in the irradiated group was 31% (19 out of 61) and that in the nonirradiated group was 32% (7 out of 22).
The incidence of mammary carcinoma for each genotype was similar between irradiated and non-irradiated groups.
Thus, irradiation may not elevate the incidence of the tumours.
Altogether, irradiation markedly hastened mammary carcinoma development in the p53+/- mice, in which mammary carcinomas developed spontaneously.
Furthermore, irradiation also induced lymphomas, mainly thymic lymphomas, in all four genotypes of mice.
The incidence of the lymphomas did not differ significantly among the four groups, with different genotypes for p53 and Atm genes.
A high incidence of thymic lymphoma was observed in previous studies performed using p53 heterozygous deficient F1 mice.
In the present study an extremely high incidence of tumours, most of which were mammary carcinomas and thymic lymphomas, was observed in irradiated p53+/- Atm+/- mice.
The wild-type alleles of the p53 and Atm genes were examined in mammary carcinoma tissue from heterozygous mice.
The wild-type p53 allele was lost in 25 (96%) out of 26 mammary carcinomas from irradiated p53+/- mice and in all of 15 mammary carcinomas from nonirradiated p53+/- mice, regardless of Atm gene status.
Only one mammary carcinoma in irradiated p53+/+ Atm+/+ mice (Table 2) was found to retain the p53 wild-type allele.
On the other hand, wild-type Atm allele was preserved in all of 17 mammary carcinomas from irradiated Atm+/- mice and in all of 10 mammary carcinomas from irradiated Atm+/+ mice, regardless of p53 gene status.
Wild-type Atm allele was also retained in nine out of 10 mammary carcinomas from nonirradiated Atm+/- mice and in all of five mammary carcinomas from nonirradiated Atm+/+ mice.
These results suggest that the homozygous loss of the p53 allele was a necessary condition for the development of mammary carcinomas, whereas the Atm null allele exhibited haploinsufficiency.
Haploinsufficiency for tumour development was reported for the Nbn knockout mice, the mouse homologue of NBS1.
Heterozygosity for the Nbn knockout allele rendered the mice susceptible to tumour development, yet the Nbn wild-type allele was fully retained in all 12 tumours examined.
p27 heterozygotes are also predisposed to tumours in multiple tissues when challenged with irradiation or a chemical carcinogen, and in the developed tumours the remaining wild-type allele is neither mutated nor silenced, indicating that p27 is haploinsufficient for tumour suppression.
In that study, heterozygous Atm knockout enhanced mammary carcinoma development in p53-heterozygous deficient mice, but the effect of Atm deficiency was not as profound.
A previous study showed that heterozygosity for the Atm knockout allele did not enhance tumour development but that dominant-negative type missense mutations in the Atm gene did.
In humans, heterozygosity of the truncation-type mutations, which represent the majority of Atm mutations that occur in humans, had no effect on carcinogenesis, suggesting that enhancement in tumourigenesis depends strongly on mutation type.
However, in the present study we demonstrated that haploinsufficiency does occur for the Atm null allele in combination with heterozygous deficiency in the p53 gene.
The p53 heterozygous deficient BALB/c mice, which developed mammary carcinomas early and efficiently, may represent a useful model for the study of effects of genes other than Atm on mammary carcinogenesis.
F1 mice between different subspecies may also provide an experimental system for precise genome-wide allelotype analysis of genes that cooperate with p53.
Tumourigenesis is strongly enhanced in mice with homogeneous deficiency in the p53 or Atm gene.
In the present study we tested the effect of haploinsufficiency of the Atm gene on mammary tumourigenesis after X-irradiation in p53+/- mice of the BALB/cHeA x MSM/Ms background.
Singly heterozygous p53+/- mice X-irradiated (5 Gy) at age 5 weeks developed mammary carcinomas at around 25 weeks of age, and the final incidence of mammary carcinoma at 39 weeks was 31% (19 out of 61).
Introduction of the heterozygous Atm alleles into the background of the p53+/- genotype significantly increased the incidence of mammary carcinomas to 58% (32 out of 55) and increased the average number of mammary carcinomas per mouse.
However, it apparently did not change the latency of mammary carcinoma development.
In nonirradiated mice, introduction of the Atm+/- allele into p53+/- mice also tended to increase spontaneous incidence of mammary carcinoma.
In contrast, almost none of the p53+/+ mice developed mammary carcinoma, regardless of the Atm gene status and whether mice were subjected to irradiation.
In almost all of the spontaneous and radiation-induced mammary carcinomas, the wild-type p53 allele was found to be lost whereas the wild-type Atm allele was retained, suggesting haploinsufficiency of the latter gene in mammary carcinoma development.
Thus, doubly heterozygous mice represent a useful model system with which to analyze the interaction of heterozygous genotypes for p53, Atm and other genes and their effect on mammary carcinogenesis.

This paper summarizes current knowledge on ionizing radiation-associated breast cancer in the context of established breast cancer risk factors, the radiation dose-response relationship, and modifiers of dose response, taking into account epidemiological studies and animal experiments.
Available epidemiological data support a linear dose-response relationship down to doses as low as about 100 mSv.
However, the magnitude of risk per unit dose depends strongly on when radiation exposure occurs: exposure before the age of 20 years carries the greatest risk.
Other characteristics that may influence the magnitude of dose-specific risk include attained age (that is, age at observation for risk), age at first full-term birth, parity, and possibly a history of benign breast disease, exposure to radiation while pregnant, and genetic factors.
The mammary gland is very sensitive to radiation-associated carcinogenesis, especially after exposures at young ages.
Many aspects of the association between radiation and breast cancer have been elucidated in the past decades.
This review is intended to summarize widely recognized features of radiation-associated breast cancer and to add a more detailed overview of relevant recent findings, especially focusing on factors that modify the radiation-related risk.
In 2000, breast cancer was the most common malignant disease in women worldwide, with an estimated 1.05 million cases.
Owing to high levels of screening in developed countries and the relatively favorable prognosis of early-stage disease, it is also the most prevalent malignancy in women, with almost 4 million women alive who have had breast cancer in the past 5 years.
In the USA, it is estimated that about 216,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and that 40,000 will die from the disease.
Male breast cancer is a rare disease, with an incidence about 1/100 of that for female breast cancer.
Breast cancer is very rare before age 30 years, after which incidence rises steeply with advancing age up to about age 50 years.
Thereafter, incidence still increases with age, but more slowly.
The strong dependence on age, as seen for many other adult-type cancers, is probably related to accumulating genetic damage that occurs during a human lifespan.
The apparent change in slope of the age-incidence curve at about age 50 years is unique for breast cancer, and this is presumably related to hormonal changes associated with menopause, which is accompanied by a decrease in circulating estrogen levels.
Estrogens and other hormones are thought to affect the progression of initiated mammary gland cells in the path to malignancy.
This has been shown clearly in early rodent studies, where chemical-associated or radiation-associated mammary tumors were most abundant after additional hormonal stimulation.
Post-menopausal women might therefore experience less tumor progression than premenopausal women.
This concept of hormonal carcinogenesis is also consistent with epidemiological observations that late menarche and early menopause have a protective effect against breast cancer.
Women who have a late menarche and/or early menopause have a smaller number of menstrual cycles and therefore shorter exposure to ovarian hormones during the reproductive years than women who have early menarche and/or late menopause.
Parity and an early first full-term pregnancy (FFTP) both have been shown to decrease the long-term breast cancer risk.
Before pregnancy, mammary gland cells are in a vulnerable undifferentiated state but differentiate to functioning milk-producing structures during pregnancy.
It is thought that pregnancies, and FFTP in particular, consecutively decrease the pool of vulnerable breast cells.
Interestingly, young women are at increased risk for breast cancer in the 5 years post-partum, possibly related to the promoting effects of the hormonal milieu of pregnancy.
The short-term increased risk for breast cancer was highest for women delivering a first child at older ages, who might have accumulated more premalignant conditions than younger women.
This dual-effect phenomenon, namely the short-term increasing, but long-term reducing, effects of pregnancy on breast cancer risk, has been shown not only for a first pregnancy but also for subsequent pregnancies.
In addition, the breast cancer risk for women with FFTP in the age range 30-34 years approaches that of nulliparous women, whereas those delivering their firstborn after age 35 years are at higher risk than nulliparous women.
The postulated role of hormones in mammary carcinogenesis was corroborated by studies showing dose-dependent increasing risks associated with increasing levels of endogenous sex hormone levels in blood.
Exogenous hormones such as oral contraceptives and post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy also have been linked to increased breast cancer risk.
An international pooled analysis showed that breast cancer risk was increased, by 20%, for women who used oral contraceptives up to breast cancer diagnosis, but not for women who stopped using oral contraceptives more than 10 years before cancer diagnosis.
Other risk factors for breast cancer include a history of certain types of benign breast disease (BBD), mammographically dense tissue, high body mass index among post-menopausal women, height, and alcohol use.
Also implicated are exposures in utero and during childhood to estrogens and other hormones, as well as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and other indicators of energy balance and growth.
However, the mechanistic details remain to be elucidated.
Family history of breast cancer has long been recognized as another breast cancer risk factor and has been evaluated by meta-analysis of published data and analysis of pooled individual-level data.
Breast cancer risk increases with the number of affected first-degree relatives.
Risk also seems to be greater for women with a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age (usually defined as less than 50 years).
Highly penetrant mutations in the heritable breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for some of the relationship between family history and breast cancer risk, whereas other inherited genetic traits, habits, and shared environment are also likely contributors.
Using a database of almost 45,000 twins, Lichtenstein and colleagues estimated that 27% of all breast cancer can be explained by genetic factors or their interaction with environmental factors, although inherited susceptibility mutations in BCRA1 and BRCA2 seem to account for less than 10% of all breast cancer cases (irrespective of family history).
BRCA1 mutations have been suggested to account for about 45% of breast cancer cases with a family history of breast cancer.
BRCA1 mutations, which seem to be more prevalent than BRCA2 mutations, probably account for a greater share of breast cancer cases.
Although the roles of these genes remain to be elucidated, loss of function in both alleles seems to be necessary for the characteristic increased risk of early-onset breast cancer.
The accumulated knowledge about radiation-related breast cancer risk in women derives mainly from epidemiological studies of patients exposed to diagnostic or therapeutic medical radiation and of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors.
Table 1 provides selected examples of studies, many of which include estimated radiation doses to the breast tissue.
More detailed summaries can be found in Annex I of the most recent UNSCEAR expert report on effects of ionizing radiation.
Medically exposed populations include (1) patients with scoliosis or tuberculosis monitored by X-ray or fluoroscopic examination for treatment efficacy and disease progress, (2) patients given radiotherapy for benign disorders as infants or children, (3) women of childbearing age treated with X-rays for BBD and acute post-partum mastitis, (4) childhood cancer survivors, exposed to often high-dose chest radiation at early ages, and (5) survivors of adult cancers treated with radiotherapy.
The average estimated radiation dose to the breast tissue varied considerably across these populations, ranging from 0.02 Sv to more than 20 Sv.
(The gray [Gy] is the unit of absorbed radiation dose.
The sievert [Sv] is a weighted sum of doses [dose equivalent] used for different types of radiation such as the mixed gamma and neutron radiation from the atomic bombings.
In terms of biological effectiveness, 1 Sv of mixed radiation is assumed to be equivalent to 1 Gy of gamma rays or X-rays.
For most X-rays or gamma rays that are used for medical purposes, dose in Gy and dose equivalent in Sv are numerically the same, and in the present report the dose in Gy will be treated interchangeably with the dose equivalent in Sv.)
In contrast to most other studies, the overall risk of breast cancer was not clearly elevated in the tinea capitis cohort, which had the lowest average breast dose.
It has been noted that increased breast cancer risk in a few subgroups of that cohort seemed to be related to unusually low risk in the control group.
Survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer who had had radiotherapy involving the chest are on the high end of the dose spectrum.
Finally, the Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, including 70,165 women, provides detailed risk estimates on radiation-associated breast cancer risk and covers a wide range of mixed gamma and neutron radiation levels, with neutron-weighted doses (neutron weight = 10) ranging from 0 to more than 5 Sv and a natural distribution of exposure ages.
Currently available epidemiological data are consistent with a so-called 'linear, no-threshold model' in which the excess risk of breast cancer is proportional to radiation dose.
Studies on cellular radiosensitivity have shown that cells will be killed at high radiation doses and therefore cannot develop into a tumor.
In a pooled analysis of eight studies among female populations exposed to diagnostic or therapeutic radiation for benign conditions, or exposed to the atomic bombs in Japan, there was suggestive evidence of this cell-killing effect in the form of a flattening of the linear dose-response relationship at the highest doses.
However, a recent large study among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) did not show clear evidence of such flattening, although these patients generally are exposed to very high chest doses.
A minimal latency period of 10-12 years is generally accepted.
The association is often expressed as excess relative risk (ERR) per unit of radiation dose in Sv, corresponding to the mathematical model in which risk =
ss0(1 + ss1 x dose), where ss0 breast represents the underlying population risk for cancer and ss1 represents ERR per unit dose.
The dose-specific ERR is the relative risk minus 1, or, equivalently, the excess rate divided by the baseline rate.
For breast cancer, estimated ERR per Sv varies widely.
The risk also can be expressed in terms of excess absolute risk (EAR), expressed in incident cases per 104 woman-year-Sv, or the annual number of breast cancers attributable to a radiation exposure of 1 Sv among 10,000 radiation-exposed women.
In a pooled analysis of data from different exposed populations, estimated EAR was consistent between Japanese atomic bomb survivors and US populations exposed to diagnostic radiation during lung collapse therapy for tuberculosis, or to X-ray therapy for enlarged thymus (pooled estimate 9.9, 95% confidence interval 7.1-14).
However, EAR was substantially higher for Swedish (32, 21-47) and US (15, 7.7-24) women given radiation therapy for BBD and substantially lower for two populations of Swedish women treated as infants with X-rays and radium plaques for hemangioma (pooled estimate 5.1, 1.3-11, for exposure at 6 months of age).
The authors noted that BBD is a poorly defined entity, possibly affecting baseline breast cancer risk.
In addition, dose-specific EAR was similar between atomic bomb survivors with a single, acute exposure and Massachusetts tuberculosis fluoroscopy patients with highly fractionated exposures, but acute exposures in infancy for treatment of thymic enlargement yielded risks sixfold higher than those for Swedish patients treated in infancy with protracted exposures yielding cumulative doses of 0.02-0.1 Gy to the site of future breast development.
The implications of these findings for modification of dose-specific breast cancer risk by fractionation and protraction of dose are unclear, and the results could reflect effects of yet unrecognized confounding factors.
There therefore seems to be no simple way to describe the association between radiation dose and breast cancer incidence, which varies considerably for different populations.
The variation may be due in part to differences in several factors that can modify the radiation-related risk (or dose response), as discussed below.
Women younger than age 20 years at exposure are at higher risk of radiation-associated breast cancer than those exposed at older ages.
Women more than 50 years of age old at exposure have no measurably increased risk of breast cancer.
Biologically, age is a surrogate of various stages in breast tissue development as well as a marker of cumulative endogenous hormone exposures, both of which vary considerably across a woman's lifespan.
In terms of tissue development, the normal breast is different from many other organs in that it is not fully differentiated in newborns, despite rapid proliferation and development in utero.
After a relatively quiet quiescent period in childhood, rapid proliferation and growth again take place during puberty followed by terminal endbud differentiation during a FFTP when the breast is prepared for lactation.
Periods of enhanced cell proliferation, namely in utero, puberty and pregnancy, have been proposed to represent windows of increased susceptibility for mammary carcinogenesis.
Proliferation is associated with increased levels of DNA synthesis, which in turn provides opportunities for DNA damage by mammary carcinogens and an increased probability of reproduction of unrepaired or misrepaired DNA damage to the progeny of the damaged cell.
Of the three periods during which rapid changes occur in breast tissue, there are few epidemiological data on the risk associated with fetal radiation exposure.
So far, one fatal breast cancer has been reported among 1668 females who were in utero during the atomic bomb explosions in 1945.
With regard to puberty, earlier epidemiological studies with short follow-up, or studies with partial coverage of potential age-windows of exposure, have repeatedly found the second decade of life to represent the most sensitive window in terms of susceptibility to radiation-associated breast cancer.
More recent epidemiological data suggest that exposures occurring well before puberty might confer equally elevated risks for radiation-associated breast cancer, as detailed below.
Childhood cancer survivors provide useful data on radiation-associated breast cancer (Table 1), in particular female HL patients who received high-dose radiotherapy to the chest.
Until recently, there was little opportunity to compare the effects on breast cancer risk of radiation exposures that took place during the first versus the second decade of life for two reasons.
First, long-term follow-up studies are needed before the youngest HL patients reach the ages at which breast cancers are normally observed with any frequency.
Second, HL is rare in young children; the annual incidence in 5-9-year-olds is only 10% of that in 15-19-year-olds.
Only a few childhood cancer survivor cohort studies reported on second cancers among subjects younger than 10 years at diagnosis.
Among patients treated at the youngest ages, breast cancer cases occurred in the Late Effects Study Group and Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohorts.
Most recent analyses from these cohorts used appropriate statistical methods to take into account the underlying increasing risk with increasing age and showed no statistically significant difference in breast cancer risk between those diagnosed with HL in childhood or during puberty or early adolescence.
Many other reports on HL survivors showed very high risks of breast cancer among patients diagnosed before age 15 years.
Two other recent epidemiological studies provide evidence that there is an increased risk of breast cancer for all women exposed to radiation before age 20 years, namely the atomic bomb survivor studies and the Canadian Fluoroscopy cohort study.
Early LSS analyses for risk of breast cancer among atomic bomb survivors were not informative with regard to risk among women exposed as children because this subgroup had not been observed at ages of increasing breast cancer incidence owing to insufficient follow-up, as recognized by the authors.
From the early 1980s onwards, increased breast cancer risk among those younger than 10 years of age at exposure was found in all reports, the most recent of which showed the following ERR/Sv by age at exposure: 0-4 years, 3.94; 5-14 years, 2.77; 15-19 years, 2.65; 20-39 years, 1.33.
Pregnancy represents a third window of rapid changes in the female breast tissue.
In contrast to the period in utero and during puberty, age cannot be used as a surrogate measure to define this potentially susceptible period.
Human data on breast cancer risk after irradiation of pregnant women are sparse.
A small study suggests a high risk of radiation-associated breast cancer (six cases) among 37 HL patients who had radiotherapy while pregnant.
An earlier study of 1764 female tuberculosis patients showed that, among all patients exposed to radiation, the highest rate of breast cancer incidence per unit radiation dose occurred among 20 pregnant tuberculosis patients, among whom there were two breast cancers.
Although these results are suggestive of an effect, the numbers of cases are too small to provide convincing evidence.
Animal models, in particular rats, have been used to address the potential effects of exposure age or breast tissue age on chemical-associated or radiation-associated carcinogenesis, because their lifespan (100-150 weeks) is relatively short and because they develop mammary tumors.
However, the tendency to develop natural or radiation-related fibroadenoma and/or adenocarcinoma varies greatly by strain.
After exposure to radiation, rats were treated with tumor-promoting hormones (diethylstilbestrol or estrogen) to shorten the latency and increase the quantity of tumors available for study.
In contrast to humans, it has been reported that parous rats develop more breast cancer than nulliparous rats.
Holtzman and colleagues showed no differences in mammary adenocarcinoma risk in a 10-month period after exposure in virgin, pregnant, lactating and postlactating Sprague-Dawley rats.
A similar-sized experiment but involving lifetime follow-up found comparably increased risk of radiation-associated mammary cancer for WAG/Rij rats exposed between ages 8 and 36 weeks, although none for rats exposed at the 'postmenopausal' age of 64 weeks.
Inano and colleagues included animals exposed in utero as well and found that, after 1 year of follow-up, pregnant and lactating Wistar-MS rats were more susceptible to radiation-associated mammary fibroadenoma and adenocarcinoma (compared with age-matched non-exposed animals) than virgin or unborn rats.
However, because the youngest at exposure were followed up until a much younger adult age, it is possible that they developed more breast tumors after the study cut-off date.
Because studies of cancers induced by chemical agents showed that young virgin rats were more susceptible than older rats, the authors proposed that the carcinogenic impact of chemicals and radiation in rats might involve different types of mammary stem cell.
Russo and Russo also proposed that the types and behaviors of mammary neoplasms induced by different carcinogens depend strongly on the particular structure that is directly affected by the carcinogen.
This is based on observations that malignant tumors usually arise from undifferentiated structures whereas benign lesions arise mostly from more differentiated parts of the mammary gland.
Another model of mammary gland carcinogenesis has been proposed by Nandi's group, in which the key determinant is not the status of the breast cells, but rather the hormonal milieu at the time of carcinogen exposure.
Shimada and colleagues proposed that prepubertal rats are more sensitive to radiation-associated cell killing than older animals because of a relative lack of DNA repair before puberty.
In contrast, one of the only studies that included rats (Sprague-Daley) exposed before puberty showed less adenocarcinoma than those exposed at later ages (42-225 days).
Dogs are prone to mammary tumors but have not been studied as much as rodents because of their longer lifespan.
One large experiment, involving lifelong follow-up of 672 female beagles exposed to various radiation doses at different times in the prenatal, perinatal and postnatal periods showed no overall excess of lifetime breast cancer mortality although there was increased risk of non-fatal breast cancer in the subgroup exposed to radiation in the perinatal period.
In summary we have abundant evidence from human studies to support the assertion that females exposed before age 10 years are at high risk of radiation-associated breast cancer, and thus there are other factors beside proliferative activity in the breast at the time of exposure that determine susceptibility to radiation-associated malignancies.
Data on pregnancy-related exposures (for both the female fetus and the mother) are too sparse for meaningful conclusions.
Some, but not all, animal studies show variation in susceptibility to radiation-associated mammary tumors by exposure age, breast tissue status, and hormonal factors.
Unfortunately, owing to interspecies and intraspecies variability and the obvious complexity of mammary carcinogenesis these data do not provide a unified model to explain variation in human susceptibility to radiation-associated mammary cancer.
In epidemiological follow-up studies, attained age, or age at observation for risk, is used to describe the period in the life of a subject starting with radiation exposure and ending with cancer occurrence, death, or the end of an epidemiological follow-up study.
In other words, the life of each subject in a radiation-exposed cohort can be represented by a timeline expressed in attained age, with tick marks at the age of cancer diagnosis, age at death, or age at the end of the follow-up for the study (for example 31 December 2003).
This information can then be used to calculate the risk of radiation-associated cancer at a certain age or to adjust for attained age in the cohort.
Recently published analyses of radiation-related risk of all solid cancers as a group show convincingly that the ERR declines with increasing attained age.
However, the effect of attained age on radiation-related breast cancer risk is difficult to separate from that of age at exposure, even in a population such as the atomic bomb survivors for which exposure was to a general population of all ages and follow-up has been of long duration.
For example, the correlation between age at exposure and age at diagnosis was 0.7 for breast cancers diagnosed in the LSS population between 1950 and 1990.
Interestingly, in the LSS, it turned out that the only significant effect of attained age was explained by a high risk of early-onset (before age 35 years) breast cancer in a subgroup of women, whereas the relative risk remained fairly constant for women older than 35 years at follow-up (see also the subsection 'Genetic factors' below).
This effect was independent of the strong modification of the dose response by exposure age.
In a pooled analysis the EAR increased with advancing attained age, which is consistent with the strong increase in background risk of breast cancer with increasing age.
Aside from the effects of age at exposure and attained age as readily available surrogates for biological processes, the effect of known reproductive risk factors has also been studied more directly.
Unfortunately, only a few epidemiological studies collected the necessary information and were large enough to address these questions with sufficient statistical power.
The most comprehensive analysis so far is based on a nested case-control study of 196 breast cancer patients and 566 matched controls among Japanese atomic bomb survivors.
As expected, early first birth, multiple births and long cumulative lactation history had a protective effect not only against baseline breast cancer but also against radiation-associated breast cancer in this population, in the sense that the dose-specific excess rate was reduced at least as much as the baseline rate.
The protective effect of early age at first birth held for women who were parous at the time of exposure and for women who completed a first pregnancy after radiation exposure, suggesting that an early first pregnancy may protect against the carcinogenic effects of radiation exposure on the breast regardless of whether the exposure occurred before or after the pregnancy.
This finding is supported by results from an experimental rat model system for radiation-associated mammary carcinogenesis.
Boice and Stone, in a hypothesis-generating report based on small numbers, reported higher radiation-related breast cancer risks in nulliparous versus parous tuberculosis patients, all exposed to multiple fluoroscopies.
The Rochester post-partum mastitis study showed no evidence of deviation from the additive interaction model for age at FFTP and radiation dose; the role of parity in itself could not be evaluated because all women were parous and lactating by definition.
A study of breast cancer risk among more than 17,000 female infants treated with various types of radiotherapy for skin hemangioma (67% in head, neck, or thorax) also found no effect modification by parity or age at first birth.
Despite the long period between date of treatment and date at the end of the study (45 years average, up to 76 years) this study had a high rate of completeness for breast cancer ascertainment because of linkage with the nationwide cancer registries in Sweden and a good number of breast cancer cases available for analysis (n = 245).
Recently, two partly overlapping studies evaluated dose response and its modifiers in a nested case-control study of second breast cancer among HL survivors exposed to very high radiation doses.
A strong reduction in risk of radiation-associated breast cancer was seen for women who had premature menopause due to chemotherapy or ovarian radiation exposure, as had been suggested previously.
In summary, reproductive factors seem to be important in determining the risk of radiation-related breast cancer, with suggestive evidence for a reduced risk among multiparous women, or women who had an early FFTP or very early menopause.
Motivated by earlier work, two recent reports addressed the role of BBD.
A pooled analysis of eight radiation-exposed cohorts showed that women with BBD had the highest excess rates of breast cancer after radiation therapy for those disorders; this effect was most pronounced among young women with BBD.
This observation might be partly related to heightened radiosensitivity in young women with BBD but might also be due to the underlying association of BBD and breast cancer.
Although post-partum mastitis, an inflammation of the breast after pregnancy belongs, strictly speaking, to a different class of breast disorders, women who were irradiated to treat post-partum mastitis also showed a different pattern of radiation-associated risk than was observed in the other, non-BBD radiation-exposed cohorts of women.
Others reported increased breast cancer risk in a case-control study of young women (less than 40 years) exposed to diagnostic radiation before age 20 years, but the risk was observed only among women who also reported a history of BBD.
However, these results are based on self-reported X-ray exposures rather than on medically verified exposures and/or reconstructed estimates of the radiation dose that was absorbed in the breast.
The variable 'family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer' did not act as an effect modifier in the mastitis series.
The question could not be evaluated in atomic bomb survivors because of suspected poor knowledge and/or reporting of this information.
In a case-control study among young women, medical radiation exposures before age 20 years were associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer regardless of family history of breast or ovarian cancer, whereas increased risk after adult exposures was observed only among those with a positive family history.
However, only self-reported information on X-ray exposures and family history of disease was available.
It should be kept in mind that 'family history' is only a very crude measure of possible genetic effects in that it represents a mixture of background risk of breast cancer (which is high in Western countries), shared environmental influences, genetic factors, and combinations of environmental and genetic factors.
The occurrence of early-onset breast cancer is another surrogate measure for possible genetic and other factors.
Both the atomic bomb survivor data and a Dutch cohort study of HL survivors showed a highly increased risk of early-onset breast cancer among women who were exposed to radiation in childhood or adolescence.
These findings were later replicated in an international collaborative study of 14,000 female HL survivors, including the original Dutch cohort.
When the survivors were classified by age at HL diagnosis and attained age, the highest risk was seen for early-onset breast cancer (diagnosed before age 40 years) among the group of women treated for HL before age 20 years (relative risk 33.2).
Despite speculation about a genetically susceptible subgroup, responsible genes have not been identified.
There are, however, several potential candidates.
Genes affecting DNA repair processes have been implicated in particular because DNA is a direct target for ionizing radiation in the cell.
Various types of damage caused by ionizing radiation include, for example, damage to single bases, single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks (DSBs) and multiply-damaged sites.
Single-base and single-strand damage are not specific to radiation and can be repaired rapidly and with high fidelity, by using the non-affected strand as template to fill the gaps with complementary bases.
In contrast, DSBs are caused by few other carcinogens.
It has been hypothesized that the linear dose-response relationship for relatively low radiation doses, as found for breast cancer, reflects the linear association between radiation dose and DSBs.
If left unrepaired, DSBs will in most cases lead to cell death through either apoptosis or mitotic cell death due to loss of genetic material.
Alternatively, effective DNA repair will solve the problem.
Recent cell culture studies found that DNA repair mechanisms are not activated in the presence of DSBs induced at very low radiation doses (about 1 mSv).
This may be a protective mechanism, avoiding possible misrepair.
However, if repaired incorrectly, DSBs can lead to carcinogenesis through translocations, inversions, or deletions of genetic material.
The principal mechanisms for repair of DSBs in mammalian cells are homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
Homologous recombination is an accurate process in which the unaffected chromatid is used as template; homologous recombination, however, is less frequently used than NHEJ, an error-prone process of illegitimately linking the broken pieces back together without reference to the accurate base pairing.
The resulting chromosomes are probably a major contributor to the first step in the carcinogenic path of ionizing radiation.
Each repair process involves damage recognition, a pause in the cell cycle to permit repair before the cell divides, and actual repair.
The efficacy of DNA damage repair may be influenced by genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cycle control, as well as genes encoding proteins explicitly involved in repair activities.
As the full complexity of the processes involved in DSBs is unfolding it is becoming clear that these are not entirely distinct processes because some proteins, for example those encoded by the genes ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), BRCA1, and BRCA2, might have a role in both homologous recombination and NHEJ.
Research on the interplay of genes and radiation in the etiology of breast cancer has focused on several different aspects including (1) patients with very rare heritable syndromes, characterized by radiosensitivity and high cancer risk, (2) carriers of mutations in known breast cancer susceptibility genes, and (3) genetic polymorphisms, that is, increased occurrence of so-called 'rare variants' in the population in genes that have a role in DNA repair.
Each will be discussed briefly below.
Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a very rare condition caused by mutations in the ATM gene, which is involved in cell cycle control and DNA damage recognition, in particular DSBs.
Patients with AT, who have two defective copies of the gene, are at highly increased risk of lymphohematopoietic malignancies and other disorders at young ages.
Although cells of these patients are highly radiosensitive, the risk of breast cancer in AT patients is not clear because these patients often die young, before reaching the ages at which most breast cancers in the general population usually arise.
Because AT is a recessive disorder, a substantially larger proportion (1.4%) of the population comprises so-called heterozygous carriers of an ATM mutation in only one of the two copies of the gene.
The risk of breast cancer after radiation exposure in ATM heterozygotes is unclear and has been subject to fierce debate.
Early population-based studies found no ATM mutations in breast cancer patients.
In contrast, female family members of AT patients, in particular mothers (who by definition have a defective copy of the ATM gene), did have increased breast cancer risk.
Also, cells of heterozygous carriers were reported to have intermediate radiosensitivity between AT patients and wild-type homozygotes, that is, subjects who have two normal copies.
Because many different types of ATM mutations have been identified so far, and more probably remain to be discovered, it has been suggested that ATM mutations involved with increased risk of breast cancer among ATM heterozygotes might be of a different type from the ATM mutations found in most (although not all) AT patients.
Recently, Dutch investigators used a highly selective group of breast cancer patients with early-onset disease (less than 45 years of age) and a high prevalence of bilateral disease, which are both characteristics of possible genetic susceptibility and found a high prevalence (9%) of ATM mutations, including several different types.
A much larger series that included 511 patients with bilateral disease in the USA did not confirm these results.
Although there is some evidence that the ATM gene has a role in breast cancer susceptibility and in radiosensitivity, there as yet is no direct evidence for an increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer among ATM heterozygotes.
However, sensitivity to radiation-associated mammary ductal dysplasia (a precursor for tumors) has been confirmed in mice heterozygous for AT mutations.
Like AT, Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a rare recessive genetic disorder characterized by increased radiosensitivity and predisposition for lymphohematopoietic malignancies at young age.
Currently there is no evidence that heterozygotes are at increased risk of breast cancer.
Several other human genetic disorders are characterized by high risks of cancer and potential defects in DNA repair capacity, genomic maintenance, and cell-cycle control (for example xeroderma pigmentosum, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia, retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome).
Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer of the retina that arises in young children and can be either sporadic or hereditary.
Patients with the hereditary form of the disease are born with one mutated retinoblastoma (RB) gene.
Evidence regarding breast cancer risk is scarce; three available cohort studies reported on a total of 12 cases of breast cancer only.
Further follow-up of these relatively young cohorts might elucidate the risk of breast cancer and the possible role of radiotherapy.
Metachronous second cancers of the colon and lung have been reported in the radiotherapy field in a patient with Li-Fraumeni syndrome who had radiotherapy for breast cancer.
A recent Childhood Cancer Survivor Study analysis showed that a family history of sarcoma (which is, with breast cancer, one of the hallmarks of Li-Fraumeni syndrome) was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of a secondary breast cancer among survivors of childhood cancer.
However, there was no evidence that a family history of sarcoma enhanced the already increased risk of a secondary breast cancer after chest radiotherapy for a childhood cancer.
A systematic evaluation of radiation-related breast cancer in Li-Fraumeni syndrome has not yet been possible.
An expert committee of the International Committee on Radiological Protection concluded that the role of family cancer syndromes on population risk estimates was probably very small, with the possible exception of affected children and young adults exposed to therapeutic radiation, among whom dose-reduction in high-dose radiotherapy should be considered, within the limits of therapeutic needs.
Importantly, the committee recognized the relative paucity of data upon which to base their conclusions, in particular the knowledge on the identity, prevalence, and impact of weakly expressed mutations that do not manifest as familial cancer.
The risk of breast cancer after radiation exposure among carriers of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also is unclear.
Although tumors deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2 show marked sensitivity to ionizing radiation and drugs that produce DSBs, several cell-based studies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers failed to show increased radiosensitivity.
The low frequency of all aforementioned mutations in the population makes it challenging to study radiation-associated breast cancer risk among carriers, and so far no epidemiological data are available.
In contrast with these very rare, gene-specific mutations, more common variations in genes (polymorphisms) might cause more subtle variations in DNA repair capacity at the population level, in particular when multiple genes from one pathway are studied.
Although low-penetrance DNA repair genes represent an area of active research, currently available studies typically report main effects of the DNA repair gene polymorphisms.
It is challenging to study the combined role of genes and radiation in the etiology of breast cancer in humans because one needs a large population exposed to a range of radiation doses to ensure statistical power to detect such a gene-radiation interaction, accurate estimates of radiation dose to the breast, availability of blood samples or other biospecimen types to perform genotyping on extracted DNA, and an appropriate comparison group.
Also, the genetic mutation or polymorphism of interest is typically very rare, further complicating matters.
Thus, so far, few studies have fulfilled all of these criteria.
Efforts are underway, for example, to assess the roles of polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and low-dose chronic radiation exposure among women enrolled in the US Radiologic Technologist Cohort and the roles of both polymorphic variation in ATM and radiotherapy for the risk of contralateral breast cancer among breast cancer survivors in the Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) study.
Ionizing radiation is an established breast cancer risk factor, and the risk increases linearly with dose.
Age at exposure is a consistent modifier of the radiation-related breast cancer risk, with the highest risk seen for girls exposed before age 20 years and zero to minimal risk detected for women exposed after the menopausal ages.
Sparse data suggest a high radiation risk among women exposed while pregnant.
A small number of studies showed evidence that other etiologic factors for breast cancer, namely age at first birth (before or after radiation exposure), parity, and a history of benign breast disease, influence the risk of a radiation-related breast cancer as well.
Although the role of genetic factors in radiation-related breast cancer is of great interest, it is very challenging to study; except for a likely role of the ATM gene, so far few other genetic risk factors have been established.

Light inhibits mating and haploid fruiting of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, but the mechanisms involved were unknown.
Two genes controlling light responses were discovered through candidate gene and insertional mutagenesis approaches.
Deletion of candidate genes encoding a predicted opsin or phytochrome had no effect on mating, while strains mutated in the white collar 1 homolog gene BWC1 mated equally well in the light or the dark.
The predicted Bwc1 protein shares identity with Neurospora crassa WC-1, but lacks the zinc finger DNA binding domain.
BWC1 regulates cell fusion and repression of hyphal development after fusion in response to blue light.
In addition, bwc1 mutant strains are hypersensitive to ultraviolet light.
To identify other components required for responses to light, a novel self-fertile haploid strain was created and subjected to Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis.
One UV-sensitive mutant that filaments equally well in the light and the dark was identified and found to have an insertion in the BWC2 gene, whose product is structurally similar to N. crassa WC-2.
The C. neoformans Bwc1 and Bwc2 proteins interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay.
Deletion of BWC1 or BWC2 reduces the virulence of C. neoformans in a murine model of infection; the Bwc1-Bwc2 system thus represents a novel protein complex that influences both development and virulence in a pathogenic fungus.
These results demonstrate that a role for blue/UV light in controlling development is an ancient process that predates the divergence of the fungi into the ascomycete and basidiomycete phyla.
Two genes controlling light responses - BWC1 and BWC2 - were identified and shown to regulate development and virulence of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans
Light is the fundamental energy source for life on earth and as such is a major environmental signal for organisms from all kingdoms of life.
In the fungal kingdom, light can regulate growth, the direction of growth, asexual and sexual reproduction, and pigment formation, all of which are important aspects for the survival and dissemination of fungal species.
These processes have negative implications to many aspects of human life, as the uncontrolled proliferation of fungi can lead to devastating plant disease, mold, and human disease.
On the other hand, fungi are essential for recycling nutrients in the environment, in mycorrhizal interactions with plants, and as a source of food and pharmaceutical metabolites for humans.
Understanding the role of environmental signals in fungal development is vital to increase the benefits and decrease the costs that fungi present.
Despite the importance of light to fungal development, much has yet to be determined to illuminate the mechanisms fungi use to perceive and respond to light.
The effects of light have been investigated in model fungal species.
While spectral analyses and the morphological effects of light have been well characterized in genera such as Coprinus (a basidiomycete) or Phycomyces (a zygomycete), at the molecular level Neurospora crassa (an ascomycete) is best understood based on the functions of the white collar (wc-1 and wc-2) genes in light sensing.
In N. crassa, blue light regulates induction of carotenoid pigment production, protoperithecia (sexual fruiting body) formation and phototropism of perithecial beaks, and circadian rhythm, all of which are abolished by mutations in wc-1 or wc-2.
These two genes encode proteins with several conserved domains, including a zinc finger DNA binding domain found in both proteins.
The two proteins physically interact through PAS (conserved in Per, Arnt, Sim proteins) domains.
The WC-1 protein functions as the blue light receptor through a specialized PAS domain responsible for sensing light, oxygen, and voltage in other proteins (LOV domain), and, together with WC-2, acts as a transcription factor.
The WC-1 protein interacts with a flavin chromophore [flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] to function as the blue light receptor.
A small protein, VIVID, also perceives blue light through a LOV domain and modulates N. crassa sensitivity to light.
N. crassa has an additional four candidate photoactive protein homologs whose functions in photoperception remain elusive.
We set out to identify genes involved in the process by which light inhibits mating of the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans.
In nature, cryptococcal varieties are associated with bird excreta, soil, tree hollows, and even caves.
Thus, the light stimuli studied under laboratory conditions are highly relevant to the varying light signals the fungus experiences in the wild.
C. neoformans exists as a haploid yeast with two bipolar mating types (a and alpha).
MATa and MATalpha cells fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha that terminates in a basidium in which nuclear fusion and meiosis occur, producing four long chains of haploid basidiospores by mitosis and budding.
A similar process, known as haploid or monokaryotic fruiting, can occur with only one mating partner that also gives rise to filaments that terminate in basidium-like structures and produce short spore chains.
Spores have been implicated as an infectious propagule, further underscoring the importance of understanding the regulatory processes governing basidiospore production.
Mating and fruiting are controlled in the laboratory by stimuli such as the presence of potential mating partners (via pheromone signaling), nutrient limitation, desiccation, temperature, and light.
Many aspects of the transduction pathways for these signals have been elucidated, particularly in response to pheromones and nutrient limitation, but no components of light signaling had been reported to date for this important human pathogen.
We identify here two genes required for C. neoformans responses to light, and demonstrate their role in blue light regulation of development and sensitivity to UV light, and their requirement for full virulence of this pathogen in a mammalian host.
Mating and fruiting of C. neoformans can be variable during culturing.
Previous work in our laboratory and others has endeavored to find environmental factors that lead to this variation.
One factor identified was light; cultures wrapped in aluminum foil exhibited enhanced mating and haploid fruiting compared to cultures in the light.
Our assays used cardboard containers in which 9-cm2 holes were excised from the lid and overlaid with aluminum foil or clear plastic wrap.
Under these conditions, light inhibited both mating and haploid fruiting of C. neoformans, thereby ruling out any effects of plate-sealing on CO2 levels or desiccation (Figure 1A and 1B).
In a candidate gene approach, the C. neoformans genome was searched for homologs of fungal genes implicated in light signaling or transduction: wc-1 and wc-2, opsin, phytochrome, cryptochrome, vivid, frequency, and photolyase.
Unambiguous matches were obtained to opsin (OPS1; GenBank AY882440), phytochrome (PHY1; GenBank AY882439), and white collar 1 (BWC1; GenBank AY882437), and transcription of these genes was confirmed by RT-PCR.
Opsins are a class of seven-transmembrane proteins that bind retinal via a conserved lysine residue to form ion pumps or light receptors in animals and Archaea.
Opsins have been identified in the genomes of a number of fungi, but as yet have no known function.
Phytochromes are histidine or serine/threonine kinase red/far-red light receptors identified in plants, and more recently in bacteria (reviewed in).
Two phytochrome homologs have been noted in the genome of N. crassa, but also have as yet no known function.
The predicted wc-1 homolog contains a LOV domain, two additional PAS domains, and a nuclear localization signal.
In contrast to the N. crassa wc-1 gene, the C. neoformans homolog has no DNA binding domain; our designation of the gene as Basidiomycete White Collar 1 (BWC1) is meant to reflect this unique structure.
The three putative photoreceptor genes were mutated in a C. neoformans var.
neoformans (serotype D) strain by replacing the coding region with the URA5 gene.
Single-, double-, and triple-mutant strains were isolated following genetic crosses to test for possible redundant functions in light sensing.
The abilities to mate and to haploid-fruit in the light and dark were examined by monitoring the production of filaments.
There was no effect on mating or fruiting in strains with the opsin ops1 or phytochrome phy1 mutations, either alone or in combination (unpublished data).
In contrast, bwc1 mutants were insensitive to light.
All crosses in which both mating partners (bilateral crosses) carried the bwc1 deletion showed equivalent mating in the light and the dark, as assessed by the production of filaments after 24 h and 48 h, while in strains with a wild-type copy of BWC1, light reduced mating (Figure 1A).
In unilateral crosses, i.e., in which a bwc1 mutant strain was crossed to wild type, only a very modest increase in filamentation in the light was observed relative to crosses between two wild-type parents.
The bwc1 mutant strains exhibited more haploid fruiting in the presence of light compared to BWC1 wild-type strains, and a somewhat higher level of fruiting in the dark (Figure 1B).
Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of BWC1 into a bwc1 mutant strain restored the inhibition of mating and fruiting by light (Figure 1).
Thus, of the three candidate photoreceptor genes identified, BWC1 functions in the control of mating and fruiting by light, whereas OPS1 and PHY1 do not.
Because filament formation is a qualitative rather than a quantitive phenotype, auxotrophic derivatives of BWC1 wild-type and bwc1 mutant strains were created, and cell fusion was assayed quantitatively; fusion of two auxotrophic parents (ade2 or lys1) yields prototrophic dikaryotic or diploid strains that can grow on medium lacking adenine and lysine.
By this assay, fusion of bwc1 mutant or wild-type strains was equivalent in the dark.
However, light reduced fusion of wild-type strains 10- to 15-fold
but had no impact on fusion of the bwc1 x bwc1 or bwc1 x wild-type crosses (Figure 2, and unpublished data).
Light also inhibited self-filamentous growth of a MATa/MATalpha diploid strain.
Stable diploid strains were selected after cell fusion by incubation of strains at 37  C. Filamentation in the light and dark was examined using diploid wild-type or bwc1 mutant heterozygous or homozygous strains.
The bwc1/bwc1 mutant strain filamented equally well in the light and the dark, whereas filament development was reduced in the wild-type diploid strain in the light (see Figure 1C).
The filamentation of strains heterozygous at the BWC1 locus was inhibited by light, indicating that the bwc1 mutation is recessive (unpublished data).
These results demonstrate that BWC1 functions in light responses at both the initial cell fusion step and during subsequent filament formation.
To determine the approximate wavelengths of light that inhibit mating of C. neoformans, cell fusion was assayed during growth under colored filters at 24 and 48 h.
In four independent experiments, blue light was sufficient to inhibit cell fusion, whereas green or red wavelengths had little or no effect (see Figure 2B for a representative experiment).
In all crosses, only one mating parent required a bwc1 mutant allele to escape the inhibition of cell fusion by light.
Thus, C. neoformans Bwc1 functions similarly to the N. crassa WC-1 protein in response to blue light.
To search further for a function of OPS1, PHY1, and BWC1, growth of the single- and multiple-mutant strains was examined under a variety of in vitro conditions.
The mutations had no effect on previously identified attributes required for virulence in mammalian hosts, such as the production of the pigment melanin or the polysaccharide capsule, or growth at 37  C (unpublished data).
The ops1 and phy1 mutant strains were as sensitive to UV light as wild type, but the bwc1 mutants were markedly hypersensitive to UV light (Figure 3).
Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of the BWC1 gene into the bwc1 mutant strain restored a wild-type level of sensitivity to UV light.
Based on studies in other organisms, one target gene could be that encoding photolyase.
However, there is no evidence for a photolyase in C. neoformans, based on the lack of photoreactivation and the absence of a homolog in genome databases (unpublished data).
We conclude that Bwc1 functions in response to blue light to inhibit mating, and to UV light to regulate resistance to UV irradiation.
 C. neoformans is a species complex of three divergent varieties or sibling species.
C. neoformans var.
neoformans (serotype D), utilized in the experiments described thus far, is commonly studied because of the ready availability of established congenic mating partners.
However, this variety is uncommon in clinical settings (representing only 5% of cases), and we therefore re-isolated the bwc1, ops1, and phy1 mutations in the most common pathogenic type, C. neoformans var.
grubii (serotype A), in which congenic strains have only recently been developed.
Mating of serotype A laboratory strains is less efficient than that of the congenic serotype D strains, and their growth in the light is limited on the V8 (pH 5) medium used for genetic crosses.
Serotype A bwc1 bilateral crosses mated better in the dark than wild-type strains.
Crosses performed in the light rarely resulted in filaments and were observed to do so only in the bwc1 x bwc1 mutant bilateral crosses (unpublished data).
Using V8 (pH 7) medium and the serotype D bwc1 strains as mating type tester strains, the effects of light on mating efficiency of serotype
A could be more readily established.
When crossed to serotype D bwc1 strains, wild-type serotype
A strains yielded fewer filaments than the bwc1 mutant strains in both the light and dark, demonstrating a role for suppression of filament formation by BWC1 under both conditions (see Figure 1D).
The serotype A bwc1 strains were also found to be hypersensitive to UV light (unpublished data).
Reintroduction of the serotype A BWC1 gene complemented the mutant phenotypes of both the serotype A and D bwc1 mutants (Figures 1 and 3).
In summary, BWC1 function is conserved in two divergent cryptococcal varieties, and data derived from experiments on laboratory strains are also of significance to clinical isolates.
In contrast to the N. crassa WC-1 protein, the predicted C. neoformans Bwc1 protein has no zinc finger DNA binding domain or any other known DNA binding motif.
Matches to wc-1 were obtained from other fungi and the predicted proteins examined for these domains (Figure 4).
The proteins share a similar structure with regard to the PAS domains, and all of the ascomycete wc-1 genes examined contained a zinc finger DNA binding domain, whereas none of the basidiomycete wc-1 homologs encode products with this domain.
This suggests that the structural differences between the homologs are conserved in each phylum and are not unique to C. neoformans.
We hypothesized that Bwc1 binds to an interacting DNA binding protein, because Bwc1 would be unable to act as a transcription factor on its own.
Systematic deletion of all of the C. neoformans transcription factors, assuming these were annotated, is not technically feasible at this stage.
Similarly, standard insertional mutagenesis poses a problem because the filamentation phenotype requires that both the MATa and MATalpha mating partners bear the same mutation.
However, overexpression of a mating type-specific homeodomain protein in a haploid strain of the opposite mating type confers a self-filamentous morphology.
We reasoned that such a self-filametous strain could be employed to perform random insertional mutagenesis, and devised a screen to identify the hypothetical protein interacting with Bwc1.
The SXI1alpha gene, which encodes the MATalpha-specific homeodomain protein, was introduced into the genome of a MATa haploid strain.
The resulting MATa +SXI1alpha strain (AI49) exhibited self-filamentous growth that was regulated by temperature, light, and nutrients.
The strain grew as a budding yeast at 37  C and filamented at 25  C, and, like MATa/MATalpha diploids, filamentation was inhibited by light, and was most robust on V8 mating medium (Figure 5A).
The self-filamentous MATa +SXI1alpha haploid strain was mutated with transfer DNA (T-DNA) containing a nourseothricin resistance cassette using the trans-kingdom DNA delivery vehicle Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
Then 2,715 individual mutant strains were isolated into 96-well microtiter plates and were analyzed with a stereomicroscope to examine filament formation after 24 and 48 h of growth in the dark and light on V8 agar medium.
Three strains were isolated from this mutant library with a phenotype analogous to the bwc1 mutant in that they filamented equally well in the light and dark and were UV-hypersensitive.
The DNA regions flanking the T-DNA insertion were obtained by inverse PCR and compared to the C. neoformans genome database.
One insertion (strain 1B4) is in a predicted gene with no database similarities (GenBank EAL21986).
This gene was also identified in an independent insertion mutant with a different phenotype, and was therefore not analyzed further.
The second isolate (28H3) bears an insertion in the promoter of the RUM1a gene, which is located in the mating type locus of C. neoformans.
Intriguingly, the Ustilago maydis RUM1 homolog regulates transcription of the bE and bW homeodomain proteins, as well as of genes regulated by the bE/bW homeodomain complex.
The third isolate (25F8) contains an insertion in the promoter of a gene, designated BWC2 (for a consistent nomenclature with respect to BWC1; GenBank AY882438), which encodes a predicted protein with a PAS and a zinc finger DNA binding domain (Figure 5B).
Importantly, the predicted structure of the Bwc2 protein is strikingly similar to that of the N. crassa WC-2 protein, which does not perceive photons directly but instead interacts physically with the light sensor WC-1 and acts as a transcription factor.
We chose to examine this gene further because its structure suggested that it might physically and functionally interact with the C. neoformans Bwc1 protein.
A bwc2 mutant allele was isolated in a wild-type background by replacing the coding region with the nourseothricin resistance gene in a serotype D strain.
MATa bwc2 single- and bwc1 bwc2 double-mutant strains were isolated following genetic crosses.
In bilateral crosses, the bwc2 mutants exhibit enhanced mating in the light, whereas wild-type mating is repressed (Figure 5C).
As in the case of bwc1 mutants, the inhibition of cell fusion, and also of filament formation after fusion, were no longer repressed by light in bwc2 mutants (Figure 5D and 5E).
In addition, the bwc2 mutants were also hypersensitive to UV light (Figure 5F).
The blind and UV-hypersensitive phenotypes of the bwc1 bwc2 double mutants are comparable to those of the bwc1 and bwc2 single-mutant strains.
When a wild-type copy of the BWC2 gene was reintroduced into the bwc2 mutant strain, UV sensitivity and inhibition of mating by light were restored to the wild-type level (unpublished data).
A serotype A mutant of bwc2 was also isolated, and exhibited phenotypes similar to the serotype A bwc1 mutant: enhanced mating with the serotype D bwc2 tester strain in the light and UV sensitivity (unpublished data).
Thus, the bwc1, bwc2, and bwc1 bwc2 mutant strains all exhibit similar phenotypes, and the double-mutant phenotype is no more severe than that of the single mutants, supporting the hypothesis that the products of the two genes function in a common pathway.
A yeast two-hybrid analysis was conducted to test whether Bwc1 and Bwc2 physically interact.
cDNA clones were fused to the S. cerevisiae Gal4 transcription factor activation (AD) or DNA binding (BD) domains and expressed in a S. cerevisiae strain in which the GAL promoter regulates ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ reporter genes.
In S. cerevisiae strains expressing AD-Bwc1 and BD-Bwc2, or AD-Bwc2 and BD-Bwc1, the ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ reporter genes were all induced
and the cells grew in the absence of adenine or histidine and expressed increased levels of beta-galactosidase activity (Figure 6).
In contrast, S. cerevisiae strains containing single Gal4-Bwc1/2 fusions and the corresponding Gal4 domain did not.
These observations indicate that Bwc1 and Bwc2 can interact with one another in vivo.
There was no evidence for homodimer formation for either Bwc1 or Bwc2, and no effects of light on the reporter gene-dependent growth of the strains were observed.
Attempts to demonstrate Bwc1-Bwc2 interaction in C. neoformans itself via coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged forms of Bwc1 and Bwc2 have been unsuccessful so far, due to the low abundance of the proteins, cross-reactivity of the antibodies with endogenous fungal proteins, and loss-of-function of tagged proteins in strains overexpressing these proteins (unpublished data).
These findings demonstrate that Bwc1 and Bwc2 can physically interact when expressed in the nucleus of another fungal species, and that they can do so in a light-independent manner.
In N. crassa, light regulates transcript levels of wc-1 but not wc-2.
Transcription of BWC1 and BWC2 was assayed in the light and dark on V8 solid medium (Figure 7A).
The levels of transcript, particularly of BWC1, were very low, and therefore samples were enriched approximately 20-fold by purifying mRNA from total RNA for Northern blot analysis.
BWC1 transcript levels were constant under these conditions.
In contrast, BWC2 is up-regulated in the presence of light, except in the bwc1 mutant, demonstrating that BWC2 is a light-regulated gene and dependent on the presence of BWC1.
Thus, interestingly, the pattern of light induction of transcript levels is reversed between the two genes in C. neoformans compared to N. crassa.
The mating phenotype of bwc1 mutants suggested that Bwc1-Bwc2 regulates gene expression during mating.
Transcript abundance of the pheromone gene MFalpha1 and the homeodomain gene SXI1alpha, both of which are required for efficient mating and are known to be induced during mating and following cell fusion, was examined by Northern blot analysis of mating cultures grown in the light and dark for 24 h (Figure 7B).
In crosses with bwc1 and bwc2 mutants, transcript levels were consistently high in both the light and the dark.
In contrast, in crosses with wild-type parents the transcript levels of MFalpha1 and SXI1alpha were reduced in the light compared to the dark (Figure 7B).
These data suggest that Bwc1-Bwc2 function, directly or indirectly, to repress transcription of these two key genes that regulate mating and completion of the sexual cycle.
 C. neoformans is a pathogenic fungus that causes disease in humans and other animals.
The wild-type, bwc1, and bwc2 mutants, as well as the bwc1 + BWC1 and bwc2 + BWC2 complemented strains, were inoculated by inhalation into ten mice each, and host fitness and survival were examined daily (Figure 8).
Animals infected with the wild-type or the bwc1 + BWC1 or bwc2 + BWC2 strains all died within 30 d of inoculation (average survival = 20.5 d, 24.4 d, and 21.5 d, respectively).
In contrast, the mice infected with the bwc1 or bwc2 mutant strains were all healthy at 30 d after inoculation, and the first animal in these two groups that became moribund did so at day 37 (average survival = 43.2 and 45.1 d for bwc1 and bwc2 mutants, respectively).
Bwc1 and Bwc2 are therefore not essential for virulence, but do contribute to the rate with which the fungus causes disease in the mammalian host.
Thus, in addition to regulating development, Bwc1-Bwc2 also promote virulence.
Light inhibits both mating and a related differentiation process known as haploid fruiting in C. neoformans.
Two approaches were employed to identify genes regulating these responses to light.
First, we examined the genome of C. neoformans to identify homologs of genes involved in light perception in other organisms.
Second, we designed a novel strategy to identify genes regulating sexual differentiation, and used a self-filamentous haploid strain in an insertional mutagenesis screen to define novel genes with roles in light responses.
 Opsin, phytochrome, and white collar 1 homologs were found in the C. neoformans genome, and the function of these candidate photoreceptors was examined by gene disruption.
No phenotypes were conferred by the ops1 or phy1 mutations, but deletion of the wc-1 homolog BWC1 abolished the inhibition of mating and haploid fruiting by light.
The bwc1 mutant phenotypes in the clinical background were generally equivalent to those observed in serotype D; however, in the serotype A crosses with the bwc1 mutants, it was clear that mating inhibition occurred with a wild-type copy of BWC1 regardless of the light status.
In serotype D, inhibition of mating by light was shown to occur at both the cell fusion and the hyphal developmental stages.
Cell fusion assays revealed that only one parent requires a bwc1 mutation to circumvent repression by light, and the release from light repression in fusion is equivalent between unilateral (bwc1 x wild type) and bilateral (bwc1 x bwc1) crosses.
This observation suggests that during mating only one cell, independent of mating type, needs to commit to fusion.
Because a wild-type level of fusion was observed in unilateral crosses, rather than an expected 50% reduction, there must also be cross-talk between the two cells prior to fusion, which is probably mediated via pheromone sensing.
Analysis of diploid strains showed that once cell fusion has occurred, the wild-type Bwc1 allele of the protein has sufficient activity, even in the heterozygous state, to repress filament formation in the presence of light to a level equivalent to that observed in wild-type diploid strains.
In an assay for the wavelength responsible for inhibition of cell fusion, blue light (rather than green or red wavelengths) was found to reduce fusion efficiency between strains with an intact copy of BWC1.
No inhibition by white or blue light was observed during fusion of bwc1 mutant strains.
These data lead us to hypothesize that Bwc1 functions as a blue light photoreceptor, as is the case for N. crassa WC-1.
To test this hypothesis, we initiated efforts to analyze the photochemistry of Bwc1.
However, recombinant Bwc1 or fragments of Bwc1 expressed in E. coli cells were either produced in low quantities or were largely insoluble (unpublished data), and thus formal demonstration of photoreceptor function for Bwc1 remains to be established.
The bwc1 mutants were also hypersensitive to UV light, showing that the Bwc1 protein functions in response to both blue (approximately 400-500 nm) and UV light (approximately 200-400 nm) wavelengths.
The ability of blue or UV light to induce carotenoid formation in N. crassa was first noted a century ago.
Subsequent work has focused on light in the blue wavelengths, which is sensible given that any study on UV light and its regulation of fungal development is likely to be complicated by the effects this radiation has on cell viability and media stability.
Nevertheless, there is evidence that N. crassa also perceives UV light through WC-1.
Prior to cloning the wc-1 gene, the spectra for inhibition of circadian rhythm and for photoinduction of carotenoid production were found to lie in both the UV and blue wavelengths.
Light treatment of N. crassa changes the light absorbance properties of mycelia, and the action spectrum of this response is within both the UV and blue wavelengths and closely overlaps that of flavins, with respective peaks at 360 and 470 nm.
In particular, the action spectra from physiological data overlap with the properties of the WC-1 protein purified from N. crassa cells, as WC-1-FAD or the chromophore FAD alone show two equal excitation peaks, one at 370 nm (UV) and one at 450 nm (blue).
These data suggest that N. crassa WC-1 may also be a UV-responsive protein and function like C. neoformans in protecting the fungus from UV damage.
The induction of UV-protecting carotenoids in N. crassa by light in a WC-1-dependent manner supports this hypothesis.
Nevertheless, a UV-sensing function for the White collar proteins remains to be demonstrated through analysis of protein photochemistry and spectral and phenotypic analysis.
The predicted Bwc1 protein lacks a DNA binding domain found in the ascomycete WC-1 homologs.
We hypothesized that there must be a second protein that interacts with Bwc1, and set out to identify this component via random insertional mutagenesis.
To create a haploid self-filamentous strain of C. neoformans, we expressed the MAT-specific Sxi1alpha homeodomain protein in a MATa haploid cell, resulting in robust induction of filament development.
The self-filamentous strain was mutated with T-DNA insertions from Agrobacterium, and three mutant C. neoformans strains with equivalent filament formation in the light and the dark, and UV hypersensitivity, were isolated.
In one strain, the T-DNA insertion lies in the promoter of a gene we designated BWC2, which has an analogous structure to the N. crassa wc-2 gene (a PAS domain and zinc finger DNA binding domain) but shares much less sequence similarity relative to that between C. neoformans BWC1 and N. crassa wc-1.
The BWC2 gene was not found in the initial candidate gene search because of this low sequence similarity and because the intron structure of C. neoformans confounded its identity.
The BWC2 gene was mutated to analyze its function.
The bwc2 and bwc1 bwc2 double mutants exhibit phenotypes comparable to bwc1 single mutants, and were nonresponsive to light during mating and haploid fruiting and hypersensitive to UV irradiation, suggesting they function in the same pathway.
Furthermore, Bwc1 and Bwc2 interact in the yeast two-hybrid system, supporting a model in which the two proteins represent the integral components of a regulatory complex controlling light-regulated development.
The mating type loci of basidiomycetes have been well studied, and comprise two distinct gene sets: those that encode pheromones and those that encode homeodomain proteins, both of which control different steps in mating.
We hypothesized that transcription of the C. neoformans pheromone or homeodomain genes would be controlled via Bwc1-Bwc2.
We focused on the pheromone genes, because they are important cell-cell signaling molecules, and because mfalpha1,2,3 triple-mutant strains exhibit a reduction in fusion efficiency similar to that seen in bwc1 mutant strains.
In N. crassa, transcription of the pheromone genes is under control of the circadian clock and presumably wc-1.
The mating type specific homeodomain protein Sxi1alpha of C. neoformans is important for events after cell fusion.
Examination of the transcription of MFalpha1 and SXI1alpha in the light and dark in wild type compared to bwc1 or bwc2 crosses at 24 h showed that the MFalpha1 and SXI1alpha genes are repressed by Bwc1-Bwc2 in the light.
It is therefore likely that Bwc1-Bwc2 control mating by influencing the temporal regulation of these genes.
The roles of the C. neoformans BWC1 and BWC2 genes in virulence were examined.
We hypothesized that the fungus may be able to sense darkness within the mammalian host and use this as a signal (possibly via Bwc1-Bwc2) to induce virulence.
We also tested virulence, because several signal transduction pathways affecting C. neoformans mating also have an impact on virulence.
Disruption of both BWC1 and BWC2 reduced the ability of C. neoformans to cause disease, as mice infected with the bwc1 or bwc2 mutant strains survived twice as long as those infected with wild-type or control strains.
The Bwc1-Bwc2 system represents a novel class of protein complex that is required for cellular responses to an environmental stimulus and affects both development (mating) and virulence in pathogenic fungi.
In contrast to the cAMP signaling and calcineurin pathways, where mutants have reduced mating efficiency and virulence, here the bwc1 and bwc2 mutants have enhanced mating yet reduced virulence.
In bwc1 or bwc2 strains there was no reduction in those traits normally associated with C. neoformans virulence, such as production of melanin or capsule, or growth at 37  C or on minimal media.
Identification of the downstream targets for this complex should further elucidate the molecular basis for its role in both mating and virulence.
We propose a model for Bwc1-Bwc2 function that is similar to that of WC-1-WC-2 of N. crassa but differs in several key features (Figure 9).
In this model, C. neoformans Bwc1-Bwc2 bind to DNA in the dark and act as weak repressors to reduce filament development.
We hypothesize that photons perceived through a flavin cofactor cause a conformational change that enhances repression of filament formation and cell fusion, and activates transcription of genes required for UV resistance/DNA repair.
It is also formally possible that light causes Bwc1-Bwc2 to increase transcription of a gene that functions to repress mating, and/or represses transcription of a repressor of UV sensitivity.
The N. crassa model is similar but differs in several key features.
Recent evidence suggests that a complex of two subunits of WC-1 and one subunit of WC-2 form in response to light.
The complex positively regulates transcription of genes required for conidiation, mating, and carotenoid production, in marked contrast to the negative regulation of mating observed in C. neoformans.
Another difference is that wc-1 is light-regulated in N. crassa, while BWC2 is light-regulated in C. neoformans and BWC1 is not.
The N. crassa complex also regulates transcription of frq, and the FRQ protein feedback inhibits the complex, thereby contributing to the wiring of the circadian clock.
The roles for WC-1 and WC-2 in N. crassa photoperception also change during the day, adding to the challenge of elucidating their functions.
Future studies in C. neoformans will define downstream targets of Bwc1-Bwc2, regulation of Bwc1 and Bwc2 and their complex, and the creation of alleles of Bwc1 bearing mutations in the predicted flavin interacting domain to elucidate the proposed roles of these proteins in light perception.
Components of the White collar sensing system have been identified in other fungi (see Figure 5), and are likely to function in light responses in these and other fungal species.
Recently the Trichoderma atroviride homologs of N. crassa WC-1 and WC-2 were isolated and mutated, demonstrating a role for these genes in light-induced conidiation and the induction of photolyase.
A gene homologous to BWC1 was identified in the model basidiomycete C. cinereus as mutated in a strain defective in light-regulated development of the mushroom cap.
Developmental regulation in C. cinereus is blue-light dependent, and UV/blue light also regulate development of numerous other fungi (for review see).
A homolog of wc-1 was identified in the truffle-forming ascomycete Tubor bruchii, in which blue light inhibits hyphal growth.
Thus, this gene and its homologs may have applications even to cultivated, edible fungi.
It will be of interest to establish whether White collar-like proteins are present in the genomes of the two other fungal phyla proposed for genome sequencing, the zygomycetes and the chytrids.
The responses of the zygomycete Phycomyces to light, particularly blue and UV wavelengths, have been well characterized, and numerous mutants (e.g., ten different mad mutants) affecting responses or sensitivity to particular wavelengths have been isolated, but no photoreceptor genes have as yet been identified.
We predict that some of these known mutations will be found to affect White collar homologs.
Finally, we speculate that White collar genes could be of major significance for terrestrial life.
The discovery of the BWC1 and BWC2 genes as potential UV-blue light responsive proteins in a basidiomycete indicates that this type of protein complex is ancient in the fungal kingdom.
The fossil record shows a clear divergence of the fungal kingdom into the four phyla by the Devonian
[416-359 million years ago (mya)], and a Precambrian origin (prior to 542 mya) for the fungi has been suggested.
Margulis et al.
proposed that sexual recombination and DNA repair were coselected in the Precambrian for protection against UV light, and genes are known that control both recombination and sensitivity to UV light.
Bwc1-Bwc2 in C. neoformans regulates both UV sensitivity and sexual development, ultimately leading to recombination.
During the Silurian division (416-444 mya), the UV-protection role of the WC-1 proteins could have conferred a major selective advantage to the fungi when they and plants cocolonized the continents at a time when there was no shade from solar radiation.
The proteins could have been especially important at other times of global ecological change associated with elevated UV irradiation due to atmospheric and vegetation changes, such as at the end of the Permian (250 mya) or Cretaceous (65 mya), when there are spikes of fungi in the fossil record.
The UV-protecting ability of the WC-1 proteins is a likely selective force that has served to maintain their presence in fungi to this day.
Candidate photoreceptors were identified in the C. neoformans genome projects.
Gene transcription was tested using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) with the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States).
Three genes were mutated in serotype D strain JEC43 (MATalpha ura5) and serotype A strain JF99 (MATa ura5).
Mutations were made by biolistic introduction of disruption alleles generated by overlap PCR with 1.5-kb DNA on either side of the URA5 gene.
BWC2 was disrupted using a nourseothricin resistance cassette to replace the gene in the serotype D strain JEC21 or the serotype
A strain KN99alpha (both MATalpha).
Gene disruption was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis using standard methods.
The mutant serotype D strains were crossed to the congenic strain JEC20 (MATa) to obtain strains with the opposite mating type.
Through a series of crosses, strains with double or triple mutations in both mating types were isolated.
A set of strains with auxotrophic markers (either lys1 or ade2) with the mutation or wild type at the BWC1 locus was also generated by crossing.
The serotype A bwc1::URA5 strain was crossed to strain KN99alpha to obtain a MATalpha bwc1 strain.
For reconstitution, the BWC1 or BWC2 genes were amplified with primers JOHE8744 and JOHE8745 or JOHE12641 and JOHE12642, respectively, from genomic DNA of strain H99, and ligated adjacent to a cassette conferring resistance to neomycin (G418).
A linearized version of this vector was introduced into bwc1 or bwc2 mutant strains.
The self-filamentous serotype D strain was obtained by introducing the SXI1alpha gene adjacent to URA5 into strain JEC34 (MATa ura5).
This strain was mutated with Agrobacterium-mediated integration of T-DNA containing the NAT gene.
Strains created and primers used in strain construction are listed in Tables S1 and S2.
Strains were compared to each other and reference laboratory strains for the ability to mate in the presence of white fluorescent light (1,500-3,500 lux) or darkness on V8 medium at pH 5 (serotype A) or pH 7 (serotype A and D).
The growth of strains was also examined at 37  C on YPD medium, for melanin production on bird seed agar (70 g/L ground bird seed, 0.1% glucose, 0.05% Tween-20) or on low-glucose (0.1%) medium supplemented with the diphenolic molecule L-DOPA (100 mg/ml).
Capsule production was assayed by growing strains in liquid medium with low levels of glucose (0.5%) and iron (20 mg/L of the chelator EDDHA), and examining exclusion of India ink particles from fungal cells.
Strains were grown to logarithmic phase in liquid YPD medium and serial dilutions spotted onto YPD agar plates, which were then irradiated with UV light (0.2 min setting, approximately 48 mJ/cm2; UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene, La Jolla California, United States) to test for UV sensitivity.
Crosses between lys1 or ade2 auxotrophic strains with or without the bwc1 or bwc2 mutations were conducted under illumination modified with filters to provide blue, green, or red light (LE 4747 blue, LE 4758 green and LE 4725 red; Calumet, Bensenville Illinois, United States).
Yeast cells (1 x 107/ml) were inoculated in 5-mul drops onto V8 (pH 7) medium, and 24 or 48 h later the mating mix scraped from the surface, and cells were resuspended in sterile water and plated onto minimal medium (yeast nitrogen base; YNB) to select for prototrophs that result from fusion events.
Stable diploid yeast strains were created by incubating the cells at 37  C on YNB medium.
Strains (1.25 x 108 cells) were inoculated onto 15-cm diameter petri dishes containing V8 pH 7 medium, which induces mating.
Cells were scraped from the surface 24 h later, frozen, and lyophilized.
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Messenger RNA was isolated from 200 mug of total RNA using the PolyATtract isolation system (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States).
RNA was separated on denaturing agarose gels, blotted to nitrocellulose (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad, Hercules California, United States), and probed with [32P]-dCTP-radiolabeled DNA fragments.
Probes comprising ACT1 (encoding actin), BWC1, BWC2, SXI1alpha, and MFalpha1 genes were amplified from genomic DNA (primers in Table S2).
Crosses comprised wild-type strains JEC20 x JEC21, bwc1 mutant strains AI5 (MATalpha)
x AI6 (MATa), or bwc2 mutant strains AI76 (MATalpha) x
AI78 (MATa), and were maintained in constant light or dark.
For analysis of BWC1 and BWC2 transcription, cultures of wild-type, bwc1, or bwc2 (strains JEC21, AI5, and AI76, respectively) were wrapped in aluminum foil and exposed to light 0 h, 1 h, 4 h, or 8 h prior to the end of a 24-h incubation.
cDNAs of BWC1 and BWC2 were amplified either by overlap PCR from genomic DNA or from RT-PCR from RNA, and sequenced to identify clones without errors.
Products were cloned into plasmids pGBD.c1 and pGAD.c1, and the S. cerevisiae reporter strain PJ69-4A was cotransformed with plasmids using the lithium acetate/heat shock method.
Double transformants were selected on media lacking leucine and tryptophan.
Interactions were assessed by growth in the absence of adenine or histidine (+ 5 mM 3-aminotriazole) and beta-galactosidase assays.
For murine killing assays, serotype A C. neoformans cells were used to infect 25-g female A/Jcr mice (NCI/Charles River Laboratories, Frederick, Maryland, United States) by nasal inhalation.
Ten mice were inoculated each with a 50-mul drop containing 1 x 105 yeast cells of KN99alpha, bwc1, bwc1 + BWC1 reconstituted, bwc2 and bwc2 + BWC2 reconstituted strains.
Survival data were analyzed with a logrank test to determine statistical significance.
The murine experiment protocol was approved by the Duke University Animal Use Committee.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) is functionally inactivated in the majority of cancers and is a critical mediator of DNA damage checkpoints.
Despite the critical importance of RB function in tumor suppression, the coordinate impact of RB loss on the response to environmental and therapeutic sources of damage has remained largely unexplored.
Here, we utilized a conditional knockout system to ablate RB in adult fibroblasts.
This model system enabled us to investigate the temporal role of RB loss on cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair following ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation (IR) damage.
We demonstrate that RB loss compromises rapid cell cycle arrest following UV and IR exposure in adult primary cells.
Detailed kinetic analysis of the checkpoint response revealed that disruption of the checkpoint is concomitant with RB target gene deregulation, and is not simply a manifestation of chronic RB loss.
RB loss had a differential effect upon repair of the major DNA lesions induced by IR and UV.
Whereas RB did not affect resolution of DNA double-strand breaks, RB-deficient cells exhibited accelerated repair of pyrimidine pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PP).
In parallel, this repair was coupled with enhanced expression of specific factors and the behavior of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) recruitment to replication and repair foci.
Thus, RB loss and target gene deregulation hastens the repair of specific lesions distinct from its ubiquitous role in checkpoint abrogation.
Cells have evolved complex mechanisms of genome surveillance and DNA repair to maintain genetic stability in the face of bombardment by exogenous insult.
Cell cycle checkpoint pathways are examples of evolutionarily conserved responses to DNA damage.
Following recognition of DNA lesions, such as those induced by ultraviolet radiation (UV) and ionizing radiation (IR), cell cycle checkpoints are elicited to limit the propagation of deleterious mutations to daughter cells.
Several checkpoint proteins play essential roles in the maintenance of appropriate DNA damage response.
A critical mediator of cell cycle control involved in the DNA damage checkpoint is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB).
During early G1 phase of the cell cycle, hypophosphorylated RB is active and binds to members of the E2F transcription factor family to antagonize their function.
The RB-E2F complex forms on the promoters of a multitude of E2F target genes to repress transcription.
E2F is known to regulate many downstream targets that are involved in cell cycle progression (e.g. cyclin A, cyclin E, cdc2 and cdk2) and DNA replication [e.g. proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), mini-chromosome maintenance-7 (MCM-7), topoisomerase IIalpha, thymidine kinase].
Due to the requisite nature of these target genes, RB-mediated transcriptional repression inhibits progression into S-phase.
Control of RB binding to E2Fs is exerted in mid-G1 by the activation of cdk4/cyclin D1 and cdk2/cyclin E, which phosphorylate and inactivate RB thereby allowing S-phase entry.
DNA damage has the general influence of activating RB by promoting dephosphorylation.
Following DNA damage, the presence of RB is required for cell cycle inhibition.
This response has typically been assessed using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, wherein RB is believed to facilitate arrest by transcriptional repression of key targets.
However, prior studies have been limited to analysis of the effect of chronic RB loss, rather than the acute inactivation evident in cancer.
It has been reported that RB function is impaired in the majority of cancers as the activities of several disparate mechanisms result in its functional inactivation.
Presumably, RB loss contributes to genetic instability by allowing cells to evade cell cycle regulation and facilitating DNA damage checkpoint bypass.
Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that RB suppresses the development of aneuploidy following damage.
While RB is implicated in gross chromosome instability, its effect on DNA repair remains unexplored.
However, a role for RB in repair has recently been suggested by the finding that several RB/E2F regulated genes are involved in the repair of UV and IR damage.
Therefore, it can be envisioned that RB loss and downstream target deregulation could have distinct effects upon the cellular response to genotoxic insult, including both checkpoint deregulation and aberrant repair.
To probe these responses, we investigated the role of RB in UV and IR damage signaling, checkpoint activation and lesion repair in adult primary cells containing acute RB loss.
Here, we report that RB function is critical for induction of a rapid cell cycle checkpoint in response to these agents.
Additionally, we find that the DNA damage checkpoint bypass is concomitant with RB deletion and downstream target deregulation.
Abrogation of the DNA damage checkpoint was associated with accelerated pyrimidine pyrimidone photoproduct (6-4 PP) repair and rapid engagement of DNA damage repair factors.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that RB loss facilitates abrogation of transient cell cycle arrest following environmentally and therapeutically relevant doses of UV and IR, while contributing specifically to the acceleration of UV lesion repair.
Floxed Rb mice (RbloxP/loxP) of mixed 129/FVBN background, at least five weeks of age, were sacrificed by CO2 anesthetization followed by cervical dislocation.
Fibroblasts were isolated from the peritoneal fascia by excision, mincing of the peritoneum and constant agitation for 40 min at 37 C in 0.2 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Sigma) supplemented with 100 U Dnase I (Roche).
The dissociated tissue was washed with PBS and subsequently incubated for 20 min at 37 C in 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) with constant agitation.
After two PBS washes, the isolated cells were plated in tissue culture dishes.
RbloxP/loxP murine adult fibroblasts (MAFs) were subcultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37 C in air containing 5% CO2.
In this study, all primary cells were between passages 2 and 4.
Replication defective recombinant adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) or GFP in addition to Cre recombinase (Ad-GFP-Cre) were obtained from G. Leone (Department of Molecular Genetics, Ohio State University).
The conditional RB knockout in primary RbloxP/loxP MAFs were attained by infecting cells with adenovirus at approximately 2 x 107 virus particles per dish to achieve an infection efficiency of 90-95% as determined by GFP fluorescence.
Cells were cultured for at least four days post-adenoviral infection prior to use while the passage number and length of time post-infection remained consistent throughout all experiments unless otherwise stated.
Cells infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre were harvested by trypsinization and lysed in RIPA buffer.
Equal amounts of protein, as determined by Bio-RAD DC assay, were resolved by SDS-PAGE.
Specific proteins were detected by standard immunoblotting procedures using the following primary antibodies: (Santa Cruz, 1:500 dilution) PCNA (pc10), Cyclin E (HE12), Cyclin A (C-19), MCM-7 (141.2), Cyclin B1 (GNS1), Lamin B (sc-6217), anti-RB (G3-245, Becton Dickson, 1:100 dilution), total p53 Ab-3 (Oncogene OP29, 1:250 dilution) and phospho-p53 ser-18 (Cell Signaling 9284S, 1:500 dilution).
RT-PCR analysis was performed to verify adenoviral-Cre-mediated recombination in primary MAFs.
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Gibco) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 mug of RNA with the SuperScript RT-PCR system (Gibco) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
cDNAs were amplified using PCR and the following primers: (sense) 5'-CCTTGAACCTGCTTGTCCTC-3' and (antisense) 5'-GAAGGCGTGCACAGAGTGTA-3'.
PCR conditions consisted of initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 C, 30 s at 52 C and 1 min at 72 C, followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 C. Ten microliters of PCR product was run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Primary MAFs infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre were seeded on coverslips in 6-well dishes and allowed to adhere.
Cells were treated at room temperature either with ionizing radiation through exposure to 137Cs (dose rate: 0.67 Gy/min) in tissue culture media or with ultraviolet irradiation (UVC) (low pressure mercury lamp;
Mineralight lamp model UVG-11; UVP, Inc. San Gabriel, CA) following removal of DMEM and washing the cells twice with PBS.
Treated cells were labeled with BrdU (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to detect DNA synthesis, then washed, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, and processed to detect and quantitate BrdU incorporation by immunofluorescence and cell scoring as previously described.
All BrdU results are expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells set to 100%.
PCNA extraction and immunofluorescence was performed as previously described using the monoclonal pc10 PCNA antibody (Santa Cruz).
gammaH2AX immunofluorescence was performed as previously described using an anti-phospho-H2AX ser-139 mouse primary antibody (Upstate Biotechnology).
CPD and 6-4 photoproduct (6-4 PP) staining was performed as described in Wang et al.
using antibodies generously contributed by Dr Tsukasa Matsunaga (Kanazawa University, Japan).
Relative staining intensities of gammaH2AX, CPD lesions and 6-4 PP were quantified by capturing images of equal exposure using microscopy and performing densitomery using Metamorph.
All data are from 10 nuclei captured on random fields.
CPD and 6-4 PP present in cellular DNA were detected and quantified by slot blot.
Total genomic DNA was extracted using the DNEasy tissue kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.
DNA was quantified through spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis prior to denaturation through boiling and sonication.
Increasing concentrations of DNA were loaded for slot blot transfer using a vacuum blotter and hybridization onto a Nytran membrane.
The membrane was blocked in 10% milk/1x saline-tween and probed with either 1:1000 primary monoclonal antibody specific for CPD or 6-4 PP DNA lesions (T. Matsunaga).
Filters were then processed according to standard western blot protocol and lesion abundance was quantified using densitometry following the subtraction of background.
To control for equal loading, experiments were done in triplicate and percent reduction was calculated between equal DNA concentrations from different time points within the same cell type.
Studies of RB function have historically utilized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) harboring loss of RB throughout development or extensively cultured tumor lines.
There is a caveat in these models, in that RB loss is compensated by RB related pocket proteins (i.e. p107 and p130) during development.
In contrast, RB is acutely lost in the majority of cancer cases.
Thus, we utilized an knockout system involving mice harboring a conditional Rb allele in which loxP sites flank Rb exon 19 (RbloxP/loxP mice).
Through adenoviral expression of Cre recombinase, acute RB loss can be achieved in genetically stable MAFs.
To examine the action of RB in cells, MAFs were initially infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing both GFP and Cre recombinase (Ad-GFP-Cre) or GFP alone (Ad-GFP) as a control.
Efficient infection of cells was evident following 16-24 h, as >90% of Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells demonstrated high levels of GFP fluorescence (data not shown).
Confirmation of Cre-mediated recombination was performed by RT-PCR analysis using primers in exons 18 and 20 of the Rb gene.
RNA was prepared from uninfected MAFs or those infected with Ad-GFP-Cre at 72 h post-infection.
RT-PCR analysis revealed loss of Rb RNA and accumulation of the Deltaexon19 transcript in the infected cells relative to the control (Figure 1A).
Immunoblotting with anti-RB monoclonal antibody revealed that the Cre-mediated recombination resulted in acute downregulation of RB protein in Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs (Figure 1B).
To delineate the consequence of conditional RB ablation on the RB/E2F signaling axis, MAFs infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre were harvested five days post-infection and levels of specific RB target proteins were analyzed by immunoblot.
Relative to control (Figure 1C, lane 1), the Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs exhibited increased levels of proteins downstream of RB signaling including, PCNA, cyclin E and cyclin A (lane 2).
No changes were detected in lamin B protein levels, which served as a loading control.
Therefore, RB deletion in primary adult cells results in target gene deregulation.
To evaluate the role of RB in the DNA damage response of adult fibroblasts, asynchronously proliferating Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs were exposed to 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV and subsequently cultured for 10 h to elicit the checkpoint response.
Cells were pulse labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 h and the replicative fraction of treated cells was determined by immunofluorescent detection of BrdU incorporation.
MAFs containing functional RB exhibited a dose-dependent cell cycle inhibition (relative to untreated control), whereas cells lacking RB exhibited minimal responses at each dose (Figure 1D, top panel).
Similar results were evident when the response to therapeutic doses of IR was investigated in the same manner.
Following exposure to 0, 2.5 or 5 Gy IR, Ad-GFP infected MAFs exhibited a robust dose-dependent inhibition of cell cycle in which BrdU incorporation was reduced by greater than 75%, while Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells were largely unaffected (Figure 1D, bottom panel).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that acute deletion of RB in primary adult cells results in abrogation of the DNA damage checkpoint response to both IR and UV irradiation.
Traditionally, RB has been characterized as participating in checkpoint responses with delayed kinetics.
In part, this is due to the use of chemotherapeutic agents wherein the induction of DNA damage is delayed due to drug action.
Thus, one of the advantages of studying the cellular response to UV or IR is the immediate induction of DNA damage.
To understand the kinetics of cell cycle attenuation following exposure to UV and IR, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs were exposed to either 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV or 0, 2.5 or 5 Gy IR and cultured.
Following damage, cells were pulsed with BrdU for the final 2 h in culture prior to harvesting at 2, 4 and 6 h.
The DNA damage checkpoint was evident as early as 2 h following exposure to either UV or IR as determined by immunofluorescent detection of BrdU incorporation (Figure 2A).
Additionally, this response was maintained for at least 6 h following damage.
Surprisingly, this rapid response to UV and IR damage was compromised in RB-deficient cells, as Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs largely bypassed cell cycle inhibition at each time point.
These data indicate that RB loss is sufficient to bypass the rapid checkpoint response to DNA damage.
Since it is postulated that RB signals via repression of target genes, we investigated the rapid action of DNA damage on RB target genes.
In response to IR or UV damage, ser-18 of p53 (homologous to human ser-15) is known to be rapidly phosphorylated by ATM family kinases.
Therefore, as a control for upstream signaling, immunoblotting for total p53 and phospho-p53 ser-18 was performed.
To analyze rapid DNA damage signaling, MAFs infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre were treated with 10 J/m2 UV or 2.5 Gy IR and harvested 2 h following treatment and analyzed for total p53 expression by immunoblot (Figure 2B, top panel).
Lamin B serves as a control for equal loading.
As expected, both cultures exhibited similar inductions of p53 following either UV or IR damage.
To further probe the induction kinetics of p53, phospho-p53 expression was analyzed at 0, 1, 3 and 5 h post-treatment (Figure 2B, bottom panel).
Not surprisingly, both cultures exhibited relatively equal kinetics of phospho-p53 induction.
However, phospho-p53 induction was slightly faster in response to IR than UV and its response to UV persisted longer than that from IR exposure.
To subsequently characterize expression levels of downstream RB targets, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs were analyzed at 0, 3 and 5 h following 10 J/m2 UV (Figure 2C, top panel) or 2.5 Gy IR (Figure 2C, bottom panel) exposure.
Interestingly, expression levels of PCNA, MCM-7 and cyclin A remained relatively constant during the rapid response to UV and IR indicating that RB action did not affect levels of these downstream targets during checkpoint induction.
Equal loading was verified by lamin B immunoblot.
These data argue that the rapid function of RB in cell cycle arrest following DNA damage does not apparently involve attenuation of target genes.
Although it is understood that RB function is necessary for proper regulation of downstream targets and the DNA damage checkpoint response, the kinetic ordering of these events has not been established.
Specifically, the data shown above suggests that while RB may not actively cause the checkpoint, RB loss could enable checkpoint bypass through the accumulation of RB target gene products.
To determine whether loss of RB protein or target gene deregulation is more closely coupled to loss of checkpoint function, we examined the discrete kinetics of this pathway.
Asynchronous MAFs were infected (T = 0 h) and harvested for immunoblot every 12 h for 48 h. Immunoblot analysis revealed complete loss of RB protein by 24 h post-Ad-GFP-Cre infection (Figure 3A).
Analysis of RB target genes showed that the expression of several downstream targets including, MCM-7, PCNA, cyclin B1 and cyclin E, all became deregulated concurrent with RB loss.
Since disruption of checkpoint function could simply be a manifestation of chronic RB loss, we examined the nature of checkpoint function throughout the RB knockout time course.
In parallel with the previously outlined experiments, Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs were treated with UV or IR every 12 h post-infection for 96 h.
Following damage, the cells were pulsed with BrdU for 4 h and harvested for checkpoint analysis (Figure 3B).
Scoring of the populations of DNA damaged cells throughout the time course of RB knockout revealed that DNA damage checkpoint function remained intact in response to 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV irradiation through 28 h post-infection.
However, by 40 h post-infection the checkpoint response became impaired (Figure 3C, top panel), concurrent with maximal deregulation of target genes following RB protein loss (Figure 3A).
Similarly, the equivalent experimental setup was employed to investigate checkpoint function in response to IR damage signaling.
Abrogation of proper checkpoint function occurred slightly more rapidly in response to 0, 2.5 or 5 Gy IR, such that cells were able to incorporate BrdU in the presence of DNA damage by 28 h post-infection (Figure 3C, bottom panel).
Together, these data reveal that the kinetics of RB loss are concomitant with target gene deregulation and impaired DNA damage checkpoint response.
Therefore, the closely coupled dynamics of these events suggest that RB functional inactivation coincident with downstream target deregulation is required for the loss of proper cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.
Checkpoint responses are by definition reversible, presumably due to DNA damage repair.
Consistent with this notion, Ad-GFP infected cells were able to recover from the UV- and IR-induced checkpoints and re-enter the cell cycle.
As before, following 0, 2.5 or 5 Gy IR, Ad-GFP infected cells were labeled with BrdU for the final 4 h prior to harvest at 4 or 24 h post-damage.
The results demonstrated a significant increase in BrdU incorporation compared with untreated controls (set to 100%) in RB-proficient MAFs 24 h following damage, suggesting that the doses of IR used in these experiments are repairable (Figure 4A).
Since IR directly elicits DNA double-strand breaks, we next investigated the influence of RB loss upon the accumulation and relative repair of these lesions.
Here, we employed immunofluorescence with antibodies recognizing gammaH2AX, an efficient measure of double-strand break accumulation, to demonstrate the extent to which these lesions are repaired in the 24 h following damage (Figure 4B, top panel).
Interestingly, RB loss had no significant effects upon gammaH2AX foci intensity among images of the cell population taken at equal exposures following IR damage.
Both Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs displayed a similar increase in staining intensity during the first 5 h post-damage and a similar kinetic decrease in intensity from 5 to 24 h (Figure 4B, bottom panel).
In order to determine the corresponding impact of UV repair on the cell cycle, the ability of the RB-proficient cells to recover from the checkpoint and re-enter cell cycle was investigated.
Ad-GFP infected MAFs were treated with 0, 10, 20 J/m2 UV and propagated in culture while being pulse labeled with BrdU prior to harvest at 4 and 24 h. Detection of BrdU incorporation revealed the ability of RB-proficient cells to significantly recover from the UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint and resume cell cycle progression.
The percentage of BrdU positive cells significantly increased from 4 to 24 h following each dose of UV damage as compared with untreated controls (set to 100%) (Figure 4C).
To monitor the induction of UV lesions in the single-cell, the abundance of 6-4 PPs was examined by immunofluorescence immediately following damage (T = 0 h) and after 24 h of recovery (T = 24 h) (Figure 4D).
These lesions are clearly induced in MAFs by 10 J/m2 UV at T = 0
h
and are largely resolved by 24 h.
To more closely examine the kinetics of 6-4 PP repair, Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells were treated with 0, 10 or 20 J/m2 UV and harvested for 6-4 PP analysis at 0, 2, 5 and 24 h following damage.
The average pixel intensities of images taken at equal exposures were compared using Metamorph software and displayed graphically to reveal that RB-deficient cells exhibit a kinetic difference in the loss of 6-4 PP staining intensities, as compared with RB-proficient cells (Figure 4E, top panel).
To ensure that acceleration of 6-4 PP resolution was not due to infection with Ad-GFP-Cre, wild-type MAF control cells retaining
Rb were cultured and infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-Cre as before.
Wild-type cells were treated with UV and monitored for 6-4 PP repair as in the top panel of Figure 4E, to reveal that it is indeed RB loss which enhances 6-4 PP repair rather than Ad-GFP-Cre infection (Figure 4E, bottom panel).
Together, these data indicate that while RB loss plays no apparent role in the repair of IR lesions (e.g. DNA double-strand breaks), the loss of RB accelerates the repair of UV-induced 6-4 PPs.
Since the role of RB in UV-induced damage repair has been largely unexplored, we dissected the consequence of RB loss on cyclobutane pyrimidine dimmers (CPD) and 6-4 PP repair kinetics in greater detail using a more quantitative analysis.
Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs exposed to 0 or 10 J/m2 UV were harvested at 0, 5 and 10 h post-UV treatment and lysates were used to purify genomic DNA.
Increasing amounts of DNA were spotted onto Nytran membranes and immunoblotted for the abundance of both CPD and 6-4 PP lesions.
In confirmation with other studies, we reveal that MAFs are compromised for CPD repair and RB had no apparent effect upon lesion repair during the time course examined (Figure 5A, top panel).
However, the murine system has competent 6-4 PP repair pathways.
Clearly, 6-4 PP repair is functional in both RB-proficient and RB-deficient MAFs.
However, Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs exhibited a greater reduction in 6-4 PP lesions (~68%) as compared with cells infected with Ad-GFP control (~25%) at 5 and 10 h post-treatment (Figure 5A, bottom panel), indicating that RB loss contributes to the increased kinetics of UV damage-induced lesion repair.
Despite the early differential in repair kinetics, both RB-proficient and -deficient MAFs demonstrated largely complete repair of 6-4 PPs induced by 10 J/m2 UV by 24 h (Figure 5B).
Thus, RB loss accelerates 6-4 PP repair kinetics.
There are two possible explanations for the differential 6-4 PP repair kinetics among RB-proficient and -deficient cells.
First, RB has recently been implicated in the negative regulation of a wide array of repair factors (e.g. PCNA, RAD50, RAD51, MLH1, MSH2 and FEN1), thus it is possible that the elevated levels of these factors in RB-deficient cells may allow for accelerated repair of DNA damage.
Second, loss of RB-dependent DNA damage checkpoint function and resulting ongoing replication in RB-deficient cells may more quickly initiate repair factor engagement with the DNA lesion, thereby enhancing repair.
In order to examine these possibilities, we investigated the role of RB loss on the kinetics of PCNA engagement with chromatin following UV damage.
PCNA is an interesting repair factor, not only because it is regulated by RB, but also because it performs dual activities upon recruitment to chromatin in DNA replication and DNA repair.
Therefore, to dissect the significance of PCNA involvement in UV damage repair, chromatin extractions were performed on Ad-GFP and Ad-GFP-Cre infected MAFs at 0, 3 and 5 h following UV treatment.
Next, PCNA immunofluorescence was used to determine the percent of cells in the population that exhibited chromatin tethered PCNA with respect to unextracted controls.
RB-proficient cell populations exhibited a slight decrease in PCNA chromatin tethering from 0 to 3 h followed by a marked increase by 5 h following damage (Figure 6A).
In contrast, PCNA engagement with chromatin was accelerated in the RB-deficient populations, peaking at 3 h and becoming similar to Ad-GFP infected controls by 5 h post-damage.
In confirmation with previous studies, these results reveal an increase in PCNA tethering following UV exposure, indicating the involvement of PCNA in nucleotide excision repair.
In addition, this involvement in repair is accelerated in RB-deficient cells.
These experiments also revealed differential PCNA chromatin tethering patterns within the nuclei of cells following UV damage, which indicated that a shift in PCNA function was occurring during UV damage repair (Figure 6B).
Approximately 90% of tethered PCNA staining appeared in large foci in undamaged cells, indicative of replication foci (Figure 6C).
However, 3 h after exposure to 10 J/m2 UV, nearly 100% of both RB-proficient and -deficient populations of cells exhibited diffuse small punctate patterns of PCNA tethering within the nucleus.
The global nature of this PCNA staining pattern suggests that PCNA function has shifted to repair foci at this time point.
Strikingly, 5 h post-UV damage, nearly 100% of Ad-GFP infected cells continue to exhibit diffuse punctate PCNA chromatin tethering while more than 75% of Ad-GFP-Cre infected cells demonstrate localized focal patterning, as observed in the undamaged state.
These data indicate that the RB-deficient cells are able to initiate UV-induced damage repair with enhanced kinetics and that in these cells the PCNA distribution more rapidly shifted its association with repair foci to replication foci following damage.
Consistent with previous studies in MEFs, here we observed impairment of the DNA damage checkpoint and deregulated cell cycle progression following IR and UV damage in adult primary cells harboring acute RB loss (Figure 1).
Several models have been proposed which aim to describe how RB could be functioning to inhibit cell cycle progression following DNA damage.
One model places RB in direct contact with replication machinery to inhibit replication, while another suggests that RB inhibits replication indirectly, via repression of downstream targets.
Kinetic analysis of the DNA damage response in MAFs allowed us to probe the nature of RB function in checkpoint activation.
Our data indicates that downstream targets such as PCNA, cyclin A and MCM-7 are not repressed by RB during the induction of the rapid cell cycle checkpoint (Figure 2).
This data a priori supports the first model, wherein RB acts directly to inhibit replication and arrest cell cycle following recognition of DNA damage.
However, it is equally possible that the vast target gene deregulation, which occurs concomitant with RB loss, facilitates checkpoint bypass.
In an attempt to differentiate these possibilities, we closely examined the kinetics of RB deletion and DNA damage response in adult cells.
Results presented indicate that RB loss is intimately coupled with target deregulation, together facilitating checkpoint abrogation (Figure 3).
Thus, either model of RB function in checkpoint induction could be appropriate, in that RB loss prevents its direct action in replication inhibition while concurrently disrupting its function in control of downstream transcriptional targets.
The ability of cells to recognize damaged DNA and elicit cell cycle checkpoints following genotoxic insult depends upon complex signaling pathways.
Although many of the downstream pathway components in the G1/S checkpoint are involved in signaling from both UV and IR induced lesions, many of the initial upstream components vary.
In the case of IR-induced DNA double-strand break signaling, ATM kinase activity is immediately stimulated to phosphorylate a number of downstream effectors including histone H2AX, p53 and chk2.
Similarly, ATM and the rad 3 related (ATR) protein senses UV damage and participates in signal transduction via phosphorylation of many of the same effectors as ATM, such as chk2 and p53.
Our studies reveal that rapid phosphorylation of H2AX and p53 following IR and UV (p53 only) are not compromised by acute RB loss, despite the observed impairment of DNA damage checkpoint function (Figure 2).
As such, these results are consistent with literature that places RB downstream of H2AX and p53 phosphorylation in the DNA damage signaling and repair pathway.
As the function of DNA damage signaling effectors were unaffected by RB loss, we sought to understand the consequence of the differential DNA damage checkpoint function on the cellular response to DNA damage.
Because control cells exhibiting a functional checkpoint were able to resume cell cycle progression 24 h following damage, we assumed that these cells must have been able to repair a significant portion of the DNA lesions.
Thus, we sought to monitor the actual induction and removal of these lesions imparted by IR and UV damage.
Although monitoring the reduction in gammaH2AX to analyze DNA double-strand break repair following IR damage is rather qualitative, our studies revealed that RB did not play a dramatic role in IR-induced damage repair (Figure 4).
This may suggest that participants in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway are upstream of the RB/E2F axis or that those repair factors deregulated via RB loss are not rate-limiting for repair.
Next, we explored the role of RB in repair of UV-induced 6-4 PPs.
Our investigations revealed that RB loss significantly accelerated removal of 6-4 PPs during the first 10 h following exposure to UV.
However, by 24 h post-damage, the RB-proficient cells exhibited equal levels of lesion removal with the RB-deficient cells (Figures 4 and 5).
This is the first evidence indicating that RB inactivation modifies DNA damage repair.
The underlying mechanisms for this change could be multiple.
First, recent evidence suggests that RB regulates the expression of several DNA damage repair factors involved in UV damage repair processes including: FEN1, XPC, RPA2-3, RFC4 and PCNA.
As we found that the rate of repair of UV-induced damage was modified by RB loss, we investigated its effect upon the function of an RB-regulated UV damage repair factor, PCNA.
We presume that high basal levels of proteins such as PCNA enable the RB-deficient cells to complete repair processes more quickly, as we found that PCNA protein expression rapidly shifted from diffuse punctate patterning (indicative of its function in repair) to focal expression (evident in normal replication) (Figure 6).
Therefore, the observed UV repair factor dynamics are consistent with the kinetics of 6-4 PP lesion removal for each cell type.
Second, the loss of cell cycle arrest following damage may initiate faster repair, modifying the conventional view of checkpoint function being necessary for efficient lesion resolution.
Traditionally, DNA damage checkpoints are viewed as providing necessary time for recruitment of repair or apoptotic factors.
However, due to the fact that RB-deficient cells demonstrate elevated basal levels of a variety of repair factors, recruitment time may inevitably be shortened, thereby eliminating the necessity for cell cycle arrest.
In summary, the data presented indicate that RB participates in the response to UV and IR damage signaling in a differential manner.
Although RB loss abrogates the checkpoint in response to both forms of DNA damage, the consequence of this loss in each instance differs.
Following IR, the loss of checkpoint function did not affect lesion repair.
This suggests that RB-deficient cells were replicating in the presence of DNA damage for a prolonged period of time, possibly inducing secondary lesions which contribute to genomic instability and activation of apoptotic pathways.
However, following UV, RB-deficient cells rapidly repaired 6-4 PPs, potentially limiting the accumulation of detrimental replication-mediated lesions.
Although the consequences of checkpoint bypass have not been fully elucidated, there exist several possible influences of the observed rapid repair of UV lesions in RB-deficient cells.
First, accelerated 6-4 PP repair kinetics may facilitate secondary lesion development, which would explain the clinical observations that RB-deficient tumor cells are more sensitive to death upon challenge and that hereditary retinoblastoma survivors are at an increased risk for melanoma.
Second, loss of cell cycle arrest coupled with rapid 6-4 PP lesion repair may prevent proper activation of apoptotic cascades in cells harboring other UV-induced lesions (e.g. CPD), facilitating the propagation of mutations.
Because all cells are assaulted by damaging environmental signals and a high proportion of RB-deficient cancers are treated with DNA damaging therapy, understanding the effect of RB inactivation on the response to DNA damage will enhance our perceptions of tumorigenesis and cancer therapeutics.
Our results provide the framework for understanding the critical role of RB in the DNA damage response.
These data indicate that RB is required for the rapid induction of cell cycle arrest following recognition of both UV and IR damage in adult primary cells.
Additionally, RB loss in these cells is closely coupled with target gene deregulation and contributes to abrogation of checkpoint function.
Lastly, we demonstrate that although damage signaling remains unaffected, RB loss accelerates UV lesion repair and modifies repair factor dynamics.
Universal DNA base analogs having photocleavable properties would be of great interest for development of new nucleic acid fragmentation tools.
The photocleavable 7-nitroindole 2'-deoxyribonucleoside d(7-Ni) was previously shown to furnish a highly efficient approach to photochemically trigger DNA backbone cleavage at preselected position when inserted in a DNA fragment.
In the present report, we examine its potential use as universal DNA nucleoside, by analogy with the 5-nitroindole analog that is generally considered as universal base.
The d(7-Ni) phosphoramidite was incorporated into oligonucleotides.
Hybridization properties of resulting 11mer duplexes indicated a behavior close to that of the 5-nitroindole analog.
Enzymatic recognition by Klenow fragment exonuclease-free using 40mers containing the unnatural bases as templates indicated notably a decrease of the polymerase activity with preferential incorporation of dAMP opposite both the 7-Ni and 5-Ni bases.
Incorporation of the d(7-Ni) triphosphate was also studied indicating absence of significant differences between the incorporation kinetics opposite each natural base in the template.
All the hybridization and enzymatic data indicate that 7-nitroindole can be considered as a cleavable base analog, although not strictly fulfilling, like the 5-nitro isomer, all properties required for a universal base.
Design of modified nucleosides or triphosphates able to substitute for natural nucleic acids components and possessing photochemically cleavable properties is of high interest in the development of new nucleic acids fragmentation tools.
DNA fragmentation is frequently required for nucleic acids analysis (sequencing, structural analysis) and a number of cleavage techniques exist, each presenting limitations.
Restriction enzymes have been used quite frequently in many applications, however their size and sequence do not allow systematic use.
Artificial compounds able to cleave DNA have been developed.
These chemical nucleases including notably metallic complexes or photoactive derivatives necessitate addition of reagents and consequently removal of byproducts.
Direct DNA fragmentation via photochemical processes is an attractive approach allowing both spatial and temporal control and offering the advantage of being fully reagent-free, permitting DNA fragmentation in cell or during PCR reactions.
However, only a limited number of photocleavable DNA 'building blocs' have been developed.
Most consist of nucleoside analogs chemically inserted in DNA fragments and are based on the photochemical properties of the o-nitrobenzyl group.
We reported the synthesis, structure and photochemical properties of the 7-nitroindole nucleoside d(7-Ni).
Illumination of oligonucleotides containing d(7-Ni) triggers a radical process in which the excited nitro group induces an intramolecular H-1' abstraction leading quantitatively to the highly labile deoxyribonolactone moiety accompanied with loss of the 7-nitrosoindole fragment.
Subsequent mild basic or thermal treatment leads to cleavage of the DNA strand (Figure 1).
The reaction is total, rapid and sequence independent.
This photoactive 7-nitroindole heterocycle is indeed an analog of the 4-, 5- and 6-nitroindoles which have been investigated as 'universal' bases in oligonucleotides, among which the authors concluded that the 5-nitro isomer was superior giving highest duplex stability and behaving indiscriminately towards each of the four natural bases in duplex melting experiments.
'Universal base analogs' have indeed attracted much attention in recent years due to their intrinsic fundamental interest and to their potential applications as biochemical tools (use as primers for PCR and sequencing or as substrates for enzymes as triphosphates).
Apart from the afore-mentioned 5-nitroindole considered as being among the best base analogs such compounds as nitropyrroles, 8-aza-7-deazapurine-2,6-diamine or hydrophobic structures containing notably the isocarbostyryl ring have been developed.
It was thus of interest to investigate the photocleavable 7-nitroindole as a potential 'universal' base and compare it to its 5-nitroindole isomer (Figure 2).
This compound could thus possess the two complementary properties of being universal and photocleavable, an approach that has been elegantly pioneered by Pirrung in developing the DNA base analog nitropiperonyl 2'-deoxyriboside.
In the present paper, we report on the base-pairing properties of d(7-Ni) in oligonucleotide duplexes and compare it to the 5-nitroindole isomer.
We also describe enzymatic experiments to study the recognition of this unnatural nucleoside incorporated in oligonucleotides by the DNA polymerase Klenow fragment exonuclease-free as well as the synthesis and incorporation of the d(7-Ni) triphosphate by the polymerase.
All reagents were of the highest quality and commercially available.
Oligonucleotides were labeled using [gamma-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol) (NEM  Life Science) and T4 polynucleotide kinase purchased from MBI fermentas.
The Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I deficient in 3' 5' proofreading exonuclease activity (KF exo-) was obtained from MBI fermentas.
Nucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech.
Reagents used for automated synthesis were obtained from PE Biosystems.
Conventional or modified [d(7-Ni) or d(5-Ni)] oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard solid-phase beta-cyanoethylphosphoramidite method on a Expedite DNA synthesizer (Perseptive Biosystem 8900).
The nitroindole nucleoside phosphoramidite [d(7-Ni)] was prepared as previously reported.
The 40 nt long oligonucleotides were used as template in enzymatic reactions.
Melting experiments and CD were conducted on shorter oligonucleotides (11mer).
During the automated synthesis, the standard cycles for 1 mumol DNA synthesis were modified since double amounts of phosphoramidites were used for coupling and after this step also double amount of capping reagent was added.
For incorporation of the nitroindole nucleosides [d(7-Ni) or d(5-Ni)], standard coupling time was prolonged by 10 min and quantity of capping reagent multiplied by 5.
After automated synthesis, the oligomers for CD and melting experiments keeping the DMT group in 5' terminal were cleaved from the support by concentrated aqueous ammonia for 1 h, deprotected by heating at 55 C for 24 h. Finally, oligomers were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reversed-phase nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel 10 x 250 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5-35% in 20 min) in 20 mM ammonium acetate solution (pH 7).
Oligomers for enzymatic reaction were detritylated on column, cleaved from support then deprotected as described previously.
These oligomers were purified by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7 M urea.
The concentration of oligodeoxynucleotides was determined by UV.
Oligonucleotide sequences used for experiments have been reported in Table 1.
Experiments were performed on 11 bp DNA duplexes containing d(7-Ni) or d(5-Ni) paired with dG, dC, dA or dT (Figure 3).
Equimolar solutions (3 muM) of unmodified or d(7-Ni) modified oligonucleotides were mixed with their complementary strands in buffer consisting of 10 mM sodium phosphate/1 mM EDTA/100 mM NaCl adjusted to pH 7.
UV absorption spectra (at 260 nm) and melting experiments were recorded using a CARY 400 Scan UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Varian) equipped with a Peltier thermoelectric Cary temperature controller (Varian).
Before each melting experiment, samples were heated at 80 C for 5 min and cooled down slowly to ensure that the oligonucleotides were in the duplex state.
The absorbance was monitored at 260 nm from 5 to 80 C at a heating rate of 0.3 C per min.
Data were recorded every 1 min.
Melting temperatures were determined from the derivative method using the 'Cary Win UV-bio' (version 2) application software.
Error in the determination of Tm has been estimated as +-0.6 C (average of three independent measurements).
To a solution of the compound 2 (650 mg, 1.12 mmol) in 4 ml of pyridine, acetic anhydride (230 mul, 2.24 mmol) was added (see Figure 4).
The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight.
The solvents were removed under reduced pressure.
The crude intermediate product was purified by chromatography on silica gel (elution with AcOEt/cyclohexane 40/60 to 50/50).
The resulting product was then dissolved in 4.5 ml of aqueous acetic acid (80%) and stirred for 90 min at room temperature.
After evaporation of solvents under reduced pressure, the residual oil was purified on silica gel (elution with AcOEt/cyclohexane 40/60 to 60/40) to afford 3 (yellow oil, 222 mg, 62%).

The 3'-acetyl nucleoside 2 (50 mg, 150 mumol) was dehydrated by coevaporation with dry pyridine (twice) and then dissolved under argon in dry pyridine (150 mul) and dry dioxane (450 mul).
To this solution, 2-chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one (200 mul of 1 M solution freshly prepared in dry dioxane, 200 mumol) was added and stirred at room temperature under argon for 20 min.
Then tributylammonium pyrophosphate (480 mul of 0.5 M solution in dry DMF, 240 mumol) and tributylamine (195 mul, 0.8 mmol) were added simultaneously and stirred for 30 min.
The reaction mixture was then treated with iodine (3 ml of 1% solution in aqueous pyridine solution: pyridine/water =

After stirring for 10 min, solvents were removed in vacuo, then the residue was dissolved in 15 ml of water and 30 ml of concentrate ammoniac aqueous solution.
The solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature.
The aqueous solution was washed three times with dichloromethane (50 ml) and concentrated in vacuo.

5'-32P-labeled primer were annealed to template oligonucleotides (2 equivalents) in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol by heating at 70 C for 5 min then cooling to room temperature >2 h.
Reactions were conducted on modified (X)
[X = d(7-Ni), sequence 1;
X =
d(5-Ni), sequence 2] or unmodified (X = T, sequence 4) template (100 nM) hybridized to 5' end-labeled primer (sequence 3, 50 nM).
Primer extension reaction catalyzed by KF exo- (0.01 U/mul) were carried out in buffer hybridization in the presence of single dNTP (20 muM) or all four dNTPs (20 muM each) for 20 min at 30 C in a final volume of 10 mul.
Reactions were quenched in formamide loading buffer (30 mul) (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) heating at 70 C for 5 min.
Aliquots (2 mul) were loaded on a 20% denaturing PAGE.
The 5' end-labeled 18mer (sequence 12, 50 nM) was annealed to modified template containing either d(7-Ni) or d(5-Ni) (sequences 10 or 11, 0.1 muM) or unmodified template (sequences 13-16, 0.1 muM).
Duplexes were incubated with various amounts of dNTP (10-1000 muM) and KF exo- (0.005-1 U per sample depending on the template and dNTP) in a final volume of 10 mul for 2 min at 30 C in order to obtain <20% elongation of primer.
The reactions were quenched by adding 20 mul formamide dye mixture and heating at 70 C for 5 min.
The reaction mixtures were resolved by 20% denaturing PAGE and the radioactivity was quantified by means of an Imager (Typhoon 9400) and the ImageQuant program.
A plot of the initial velocity versus [dNTP] was fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Kaleida-graph (Synergy Software).
The data presented are averages of three independent determinations.
Reactions were conducted on d(7-Ni) modified template (sequences 1 or 11-13, 100 nM) or unmodified template (sequences 4-10, 100 nM) annealed to 5' end-labeled primer (sequence 3, 50 nM).
The first step relating to d(7-Ni)MP addition to the 3' primer terminus was carried out using KF exo- (0.0625 U/mul) in presence of d(7-Ni)TP (1 mM) yielding a total reaction volume of 10 mul, for 5 min at 30 C. Reaction was stopped by heating at 70 C for 5 min.
The second step of reaction consisting in adding one more monophosphate complementary to the base in 5' position of the d(7-Ni) in the template or in full-length primer extension was catalyzed by KF exo- (0.0125 U/mul) in presence of either one dNTP (500 muM) or the four dNTPs (500 muM each) in a final volume of 20 mul.
Reactions were incubated at 30 C for 20 min, then quenched with formamide loading buffer (30 mul) and analyzed by 20% denaturing PAGE.
The 7-nitroindole nucleoside triphosphate 1 was prepared using the Ludwig-Eckstein method, which allows one-pot triphosphate formation starting from 3'-protected nucleosides (see Figure 4).
Thus the 5'-trityl nucleoside 2 was first converted to 3'-protected derivative 3, which was then treated successively (i) with 2-chloro-4H-1,3,2-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one, (ii) with tributylammonium pyrophosphate, (iii) with iodine-aqueous pyridine and (iv) with aqueous ammoniac solution.
Purification of crude mixture was carried out by reverse-phase chromatography.
The triphosphate 1 was obtained with 20% overall yield and characterized by 1H and 31P NMR and by ES-MS spectrometry.
UV thermal melting studies were performed in order to assess the effects of d(7-Ni) on duplex stability relative to the natural base pairs.
Studies were performed on a series of 11mer duplexes containing the modified d(7-Ni) nucleoside in the middle of the sequence in one strand (sequence 1) with the complementary strand containing successively the four natural bases facing the 7-Ni base (sequences 3-6).
For comparison, we also determined the behavior of duplexes containing the d(5-Ni) nucleoside analog inserted in the same sequence context (sequence 2).
The unnatural self-pair 7-Ni:7-Ni containing duplex was also examined (sequence 1:sequence 9).
The sigmoidal curves alpha = f(T) obtained from the standard UV melting curves for the different duplexes exhibited melting cooperativity and were analyzed to derive the Tm values and the Van't Hoff transition enthalpy DeltaH, entropy DeltaS and free energy DeltaG .
The thermodynamics of melting were determined with the base pairs as indicated in the boxed region (Figure 3).
The resulting data are listed in Table 2.
A first observation is that the two modified nucleosides induce strong destabilization of the duplexes as compared to duplexes containing the natural bases, the d(7-Ni) nucleoside being slightly more destabilizing than the d(5-Ni) analog.
Decrease of the melting temperatures DeltaTm = 13 and 15 C were measured when natural base pairs A:T (sequence 7:sequence 6) and G:C (sequence 8:sequence 4) were replaced by the unnatural pairs 7-Ni:T (sequence 1:sequence 6) and 7-Ni:C (sequence 1:sequence 4), corresponding to loss in free energy of 5 and 6 kcal/mol, respectively.
By comparison, 5-Ni present in the same sequence context led to Tm decrease of 10 and 11 C corresponding to loss of free energy of 3 and 4 kcal/mol, respectively.
The destabilization caused by the unnatural bases is of the same order of magnitude as that caused by a mismatch [see for example, the 46 C value determined for the duplex containing one A:C mismatch in the same sequence context (sequence 7:sequence 4)].
However, when present in each of the complementary strands in opposite positions, the Tm value for the duplex containing the 7-Ni:7-Ni pair (sequence 1:sequence 9) exhibits Tm value =
51 C, i.e. in the same range as measured for the natural duplex.
Second observation relates to discrimination of 7-Ni and 5-Ni for the different natural bases.
The two bases have comparable behavior although 7-Ni shows more discrimination than 5-Ni.
Tm values are in the range 46-51 C for duplexes containing 7-Ni and all four natural bases in opposite position in complementary strand.
Values vary in the range 49-52 C for the analogous duplexes containing 5-Ni.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were also measured (data in Supplementary Material).
The CD-spectra obtained for the various unnatural base pair containing duplexes showed similarities to that of the natural parent duplex, indicating a right-handed.
Thus, the unnatural base pair does not appear to induce major structural distortions of the B-form duplex.
In general, enzyme efficiency is defined by the ability to base-pair synthesis (e.g. incorporation of a triphosphate opposite a natural or unnatural base in the template), and second, by the aptitude to extend a natural or unnatural base pair (synthesis of the next base pair).
The efficiency and the selectivity of unnatural DNA synthesis involving the d(7-Ni) nucleoside by KF exo- were examined both in the context of base-pair synthesis and base-pair extension.
Duplexes containing the 7-Ni nucleobase and for comparison 5-Ni were evaluated as substrates for the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of E.coli DNA polymerase I (KF exo-).
Studies were investigated using templates containing in the middle of the sequence one of the unnatural bases 7-Ni (sequence 10) or 5-Ni (sequence 11) hybridized to the 18mer primer (sequence 12).
For comparison, a template containing the natural base T (sequence 13) hybridized to the same 18mer primer was also examined.
The resulting duplexes were subjected to primer extension in the presence of one single dNTP (see Figure 5).
DNA synthesis on template containing the natural base (sequence 13) led to the expected incorporation of dAMP opposite T (data not shown).
When using the 7-Ni containing strand as template (sequence 10) dAMP, dGMP and dTMP were incorporated opposite the unnatural base, however, with quite different efficiencies (Figure 5, lanes 1, 3 and 4), while insertion of dCMP could not be detected (Figure 5, lane 2).
The same experiment conducted with the template containing 5-Ni indicated that dAMP was incorporated opposite the unnatural base (Figure 5, lane 5).
Kinetic parameters for insertion of dNMP opposite the modified sites were determined.
The initial velocities were measured and plotted versus [dNTP] and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the Km and kcat constants.
To allow comparison of the kinetic parameters for all substrates, the specificity constants kcat/Km were calculated.
The steady-state kinetic constants for single nucleotide incorporation are reported in Table 3.
With template containing d(7-Ni) (sequence 10), dAMP was preferentially inserted opposite the modified site.
The kcat/Km value for dAMP incorporation was respectively 11 times, 13 times and 777 times higher than measured for dGMP, dTMP and dCMP incorporation.
In addition, the d(7-Ni) nucleoside was incorporated with almost the same frequency as dAMP.
Thus, the efficiency for nucleotide insertion opposite d(7-Ni) follows the order dAMP ~ d(7-Ni)MP >> dGMP ~ dTMP > dCMP.
The same experiments performed with the template containing d(5-Ni) (sequence 11) also showed a preference for dAMP incorporation opposite the modified base, and the incorporation frequency opposite d(5-Ni) followed the same order as determined for d(7-Ni).
However, kcat/Km for dAMP incorporation was only three times higher than for dGMP and 27 times higher than for dTMP and dCMP.
The primer-templates used in these experiments were designed in order to examine the effect of changing the template base at the 5' side of d(7-Ni) on the initiation of the extension of the primer.
The 18mer primer (sequence 12) was hybridized successively to 40mer templates differing by the nature of the base N = T, A, C, G at the 5' side of d(7-Ni) (sequences 10, 17, 18 and 19, respectively) (Figure 6).
Extension of the primer in the four duplexes was conducted in the presence successively of each of the natural dNTPs.
For each duplex, dAMP (Figure 6, lanes 2, 6, 10 and 14), dGMP (Figure 6, lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16) and dTMP (Figure 6, lanes 5, 9, 13 and 17) were incorporated opposite d(7Ni).
Only dCMP was not inserted by the enzyme (lanes 3, 7, 11 and 15) even when guanosine was present at the 5' side of d(7-Ni) (Figure 6, lane 15).
It thus appears that changing a single downstream template base does not modify nucleotide incorporation opposite the unnatural 7-Ni base.
Modified templates containing one unnatural base 7-Ni (sequence 10) or 5-Ni (sequence 11) were annealed to the 18mer primer (sequence 12) and subjected to extension in the presence of the four dNTPs.
For comparison, measurements were also made by using an otherwise identical template that contained dT (sequence 13) instead of the modified nucleoside (Figure 7).
As expected, KF exo- led to fully extended 40mer products when experiments were conducted on the natural template (template: sequence 13, primer: sequence 12) (Figure 7, lane 2).
Employing identical enzyme concentrations and dNTP quantities as used for the unmodified duplex, KF exo- synthesized full-length DNA starting from both modified duplexes containing either d(7-Ni) or d(5-Ni) in the template (Figure 7, lanes 4 and 6).
However, extension was more efficient with template containing d(7-Ni).
The additional major band seen in lanes 4 and 6 results from single nucleotide extension of the primer through incorporation of a native triphosphate opposite the modified base.
The accumulation of this intermediate implies that the continued synthesis after 1 nt incorporation is slow.
Efficiency of insertion of the triphosphate of d(7-Ni) against each of the natural bases in the template has been characterized.
Experiments were run using the 18mer primer (sequence 12) hybridized successively to the four templates (sequences 13-16) varying by the nature of the base N at the initiation site of the polymerization.
The kinetic parameters for insertion of the unnatural triphosphate opposite each natural base are reported in Table 4.
Incorporation appeared to be more efficient opposite adenine (kcat/Km = 1.22 x 10-2 min-1 mM-1).
However, the kcat/Km value was only two times higher than observed for incorporation opposite the three other bases that in addition showed quite remarkably comparable values.
Furthermore, efficiency of incorporation opposite each natural base was of the same order of magnitude as incorporation of natural dAMP opposite thymine.
The ability of KF exo- to extend a primer terminated by the unnatural 7-Ni base opposite the different natural bases N in the template was studied (Figure 8).
Reactions were conducted on the 18mer primer (sequence 12) annealed to the 40mer templates in which base N19 was successively a thymine (sequence 13), an adenine (sequence 16), a cytosine (sequence 14) or a guanine (sequence 15).
In a first step, primer extension was run in the presence of the triphosphate d(7-Ni)TP (Figure 8, lanes 2, 6, 10 and 14).
Incorporation of one d(7-Ni) nucleoside was observed for all duplexes, permitting to obtain all possible unnatural base pairs 7-Ni:N.
In a second step, polymerization was continued on these extended primers in the presence either of dATP (the next complementary base in the template) (Figure 8, lanes 3, 7, 11 and 15) or in the presence of the four dNTPs (Figure 8, lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16).
No extension could be observed for the duplexes in which d(7-Ni) was facing adenine, cytosine or guanine, neither in the presence of dATP (Figure 8, lanes 7, 11 and 15) nor in the presence of the mixed dNTPs (Figure 8, lanes 8, 12 and 16).
Only the 7-Ni:T base pair was substrate for extension of the modified primer.
Moreover, in this case addition of two adenines was detected in the presence of dATP (Figure 8, lane 3) and formation of a full-length product was observed in the presence of the four natural triphosphates (Figure 8, lane 4).
In order to interpret the previous results, we investigated the possible influence of the nature of the downstream template base (N20) on the extension of the primer terminated by the 7-Ni unnatural base.
Experiments were conducted on the same 18mer primer (sequence 12) hybridized successively to 40mer templates (sequences 13, 20-22) varying only by the nature of base N20 (Figure 9).
The primers elongated by one 7-Ni base were prepared as described in the previous experiment (Figure 9, lanes 2, 6, 10 and 14).
It should be noted that the 18mer primer annealed to template in which N20 was a guanine was only partially converted in the conditions used.
In a second step, elongation was continued either in the presence of the triphosphate complementary to base N20 located 5' to thymine in the template (Figure 9, dATP: lane 3, dTTP: lane 7, dGTP: lane 11, dCTP: lane 12) or in the presence of the four dNTPs (Figure 9, lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16).
For each duplex, primers terminated by 7-Ni were extended in the presence of a unique triphosphate.
When dATP was added (duplex in which N20 is thymine) the 7-Ni primer was elongated by one or two units (Figure 9, lane 3).
In the presence of dTTP or dCTP, the 7-Ni primer was extended by 1 nt (Figure 9, lanes 7 and 15).
However, primer extension in the presence of dCTP only led to small amounts of reaction product.
Incorporation of three guanines was observed for the duplex in which the template base N was a cytosine.
Full-length extension (40mer) was observed in the presence of the mixture of the four dNTPs for all duplexes.
We have studied the impact on DNA duplex stability of the presence of the d(7-Ni) unnatural base opposite each native base.
For comparison, we also measured the stability of duplexes containing the 5-Ni analog that is generally considered as a universal base.
Thermal denaturation experiments showed that the two unnatural bases lead to strong decrease in duplex stability comparable to that caused by the presence of a mismatch.
Destabilization is slightly more important for the duplex containing the 7-Ni base as compared to the 5-Ni isomer.
Another criterion required for a universal base concerns absence of discrimination when the unnatural base in one strand faces any of the four natural bases in the complementary strand.
The two nitroindole bases have comparable behavior, exhibiting slight discrimination, the 7-Ni base being slightly more discriminating.
From a structural point of view, the CD spectra of the various duplexes containing the 7-Ni base showed the typical shape of B-DNA, indicating the absence of major distortions induced by the unnatural base.
It can thus be concluded that as far as hybridization properties are concerned, the 7-Ni base exhibits behavior comparable to that of the 5-isomer although it cannot be considered as a true universal base according to this criterion.
Replication was next examined involving the unnatural nucleobase 7-Ni both in template DNA and as triphosphate.
For comparison, recognition by KF exo- of d(5-Ni) present in the template was also studied.
In the sequence context examined, we observed that dAMP was preferentially inserted opposite both 7-Ni and 5-Ni, with rates varying by a factor close to 10.
The frequency for incorporation opposite both unnatural bases followed the order: dAMP >>
dGMP = dTMP > dCMP.
However, dAMP, dGMP and dTMP were more efficiently incorporated when facing d(7-Ni) than d(5-Ni).
dCMP was almost not inserted by the enzyme opposite each of the unnatural bases.
These results suggest that d(7-Ni) is recognized by KF exo- more efficiently than d(5-Ni).
We also investigated the effect of the sequence on nucleoside incorporation opposite d(7-Ni).
We observed that the nature of the downstream template base was without effect on the selectivity of the reaction: insertion of dAMP opposite the unnatural base was favored over dGMP, dTMP and dCMP.
The effect of 7-Ni on KF exo- seems similar to that exhibited by a large spectrum of DNA lesions, such as the abasic site for which the 'A-rule' has been defined, or the 2'-deoxyribonolactone damage.
Consequently, 7-Ni, as well as 5-Ni cannot be considered as a true universal base when present in the template, since the four natural triphosphates are not incorporated equally well in front of these unnatural bases.
Primer extension experiments investigated in the presence of the four natural triphosphates showed that d(7-Ni) like d(5-Ni) when present in the template led to a decrease of the polymerase activity.
Indeed, after addition of 1 nt, primer extension was very slow although full-length primers were obtained.
We also examined incorporation of the d(7-Ni) triphosphate opposite each natural base in the template.
Quite remarkably, the kinetic parameters determined do not reveal significant differences for insertion in front of the four natural bases, behaving in this aspect as a universal nucleotide.
The triphosphate was inserted opposite each natural base with at least the same efficiency as dAMP opposite thymine.
In addition, the d(7-Ni) triphosphate was also inserted efficiently opposite itself in the template.
Indeed, Romesberg reported that several hydrophobic aromatic nucleosides were preferentially incorporated opposite themselves, or similar structures rather than opposite natural nucleosides.
We also studied the extension of primers terminated by the unnatural base 7-Ni.
We found that 7-Ni behaves as chain terminator when facing adenine, guanine or cytosine in the template.
On the other hand, when facing thymine the 7-Ni primer was elongated by two adenines in the presence of dAMP and full-length elongation occurred in the presence of the four triphosphates.
This elongation was not dependent on the nature of the base downstream to thymine in the template.
The fact that extension of the primer terminated by 7-Ni is possible when opposed to thymine suggests recognition of 7-Ni by KF exo- as an adenine.
It thus appears that the d(7-Ni) triphosphate behaves differently from the d(5-Ni) triphosphate.
Indeed, Brown reported that once incorporated opposite natural bases, 5-nitroindole (like 3-nitropyrrole, also considered as universal base) caused chain termination.
All those hybridization and enzymatic data indicate that this newly introduced 7-nitroindole nucleoside can be considered as a photochemically cleavable nucleoside analog.
It was first designed as a precursor to prepare DNA fragments containing the highly labile deoxyribonolactone lesion.
Further work showed that it furnishes a highly efficient approach to generate DNA backbone cleavage at preselected position in the sequence.
The present work shows that 7-Ni presents some of the biophysical and enzymatic recognition properties required for a universal base analog as it shares many common features with its 5-nitroindole isomer.
It can thus be considered as a cleavable base analog, although not fulfilling strictly all requirements for a 'universal' base analog.
Indeed as pointed out in a recent review, none of the analogs reported so far does fulfill all criteria and it may be that a single analog cannot.

Hydroxyl radical is one of the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed from gamma-radiolysis of water or Fenton reaction, and it can abstract one hydrogen atom from the methyl carbon atom of thymine and 5-methylcytosine to give the 5-methyl radical of the pyrimidine bases.
The latter radical can also be induced from Type-I photo-oxidation process.
Here, we examined the reactivity of the independently generated 5-(2'-deoxycytidyl)methyl radical (I) in single- and double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs).
It was found that an intrastrand cross-link lesion, in which the methyl carbon atom of 5-methylcytosine and the C8 carbon atom of guanine are covalently bonded, could be formed from the independently generated radical at both GmC and mCG sites, with the yield being much higher at the former site.
We also showed by LC-MS/MS that the same cross-link lesions were formed in mC-containing duplex ODNs upon gamma irradiation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the yield was ~10-fold higher under the latter conditions.
The independently generated radical allows for the availability of pure, sufficient and well-characterized intrastrand cross-link lesion-bearing ODN substrates for future biochemical and biophysical characterizations.
This was also the first demonstration that the coupling of radical I with its 5' neighboring guanine can occur in the presence of molecular oxygen, suggesting that the formation of this and other types of intrastrand cross-link lesions might have important implications in the cytotoxic effects of ROS.
Cytosine in DNA can be methylated at the C5 carbon atom, and methylation occurs frequently at CpG sites in mammalian cells.
The methylated CpGs are mutational hotspots in p53 tumor suppressor gene, and the most common mutations are mC T transitions.
In addition, recent work by Lee et al. showed that oxidative DNA damage induced by copper and hydrogen peroxide can promote unusual mCG TT tandem double mutations in nucleotide excision repair-deficient human XPA cells.
DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in a number of human pathological conditions.
In this regard, hydroxyl radical is the major ROS formed from Fenton reaction or gamma-radiolysis of water.
It is well documented that hydroxyl radical can react with thymine and 5-methylcytosine by either adding to the C5 = C6 double bond or abstracting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group.
The hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group, which gives rise to the methyl radical of the pyrimidine bases (Scheme 1, I), accounts for ~10% of the secondary radical products of the pyrimidine bases formed from gamma irradiation.
Quantification of various thymidine oxidation products originating from the gamma irradiation of isolated or cellular DNA, however, indicated that, in the duplex DNA environment, the  OH may attack the methyl carbon atom more frequently than the C5, C6 carbon atoms.
Other than the  OH attack, one-electron photo-oxidation of pyrimidine nucleosides leads to the formation of the cation radical of the nucleosides, which, upon deprotonation, can also give rise to radical I (Scheme 1).
The methyl radical formed from those oxidation processes may react with the neighboring nucleobase to form intrastrand cross-link lesions (Scheme 1).
The independent generation of reactive intermediates of nucleosides, especially those from their photolabile precursors, facilitates the investigation of the roles of these reactive intermediates in DNA damage.
This approach offers a distinctive advantage over the use of ionizing radiation, Fenton reaction or other oxidative DNA damage agents, in which multiple reactive intermediates are formed.
A number of radical intermediates, such as the 5,6-dihydrothymid-5-yl radical, the 5,6-dihydrourid-6-yl radical, the 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymid-6-yl radical, the 5-(pyrimidyl)methyl radical and radicals on C1', C3' and C4', have been synthesized and their reactivities have been examined.
Recently, we reported the efficient generation of the 5-methyl radical of mC from the 254 nm irradiation of 5-phenylthiomethyl-2'-deoxycytidine.
We also showed that the independently generated I in dinucleoside monophosphates can result in the facile formation of two intrastrand cross-link lesions (mC  G and G  mC), in which the methyl carbon atom of 5-methylcytosine and the C8 carbon atom of its adjacent guanine are covalently bonded (Scheme 1).
Moreover, we demonstrated that the cross-link lesion can be induced from gamma irradiation of d(mCG) under anaerobic conditions.
Here, we extended our investigation into the reactivity of the independently generated radical I (Scheme 1) in both single- and double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs).
In addition, we examined the formation of mC  G and G  mC from the gamma irradiation of mC-containing duplex ODNs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
The radical precursor-containing phosphoramidite was synthesized as described previously.
The compound was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile at a concentration of 60 mg/ml, and ODN synthesis was carried out on a Beckman Oligo 1000S DNA synthesizer (Fullerton, CA) at 1 mumol scale.
Conventional phosphoramidite building blocks (Glen Research Inc., Sterling, VA) were employed and the factory-installed ODN assembly protocol was used without any modification.
After synthesis, the products were cleaved from the controlled-pore glass support with 29% NH4OH and deprotected with the same ammonia solution at room temperature for 48 h.
The solution was dried in a Speed-vac (Thermo Savant Inc., Holbrook, NY) and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification.
The purified ODNs were further desalted by HPLC before UV-C irradiation.
An aqueous solution, which contained radical precursor-bearing single-stranded ODNs at an absorbance of 0.4-0.6 (260 nm) and was dispersed in a quartz tube, was degassed with three cycles of freeze-pump-thaw.
The resulting solution was irradiated with 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) light from a TLC lamp (UVP Inc., Upland, CA) at room temperature for 20 min (the percent transmittance of light at this wavelength was estimated to be 25-40%), dried in a Speed-vac, redissolved in water and separated by HPLC.
The radical precursor-containing duplex ODNs were formed by annealing the two complementary strands in a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate (pH 7.0), and the annealing was carried out by heating to 90 C and cooling slowly to room temperature.
The ODN solution was then irradiated following the same procedures as described above for the single-stranded ODN.
Irradiation was also carried out under aerobic conditions, in which no freeze-pump-thaw procedure was employed and the solution was exposed to air during irradiation.
Moreover, we also irradiated the duplex ODN sample under saturated oxygen conditions, where the solution was bubbled with oxygen for 30 min before irradiation and the oxygen bubbling was continued during the whole irradiation process.
The resulting photolysate was desalted by HPLC, and the desalted solution was dried and dissolved in 200 mul H2O.
The above desalted ODN or the gamma-irradiated ODN (vide infra) was digested by nuclease P1, calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and phosphodiesterases I and II.
In this respect, the ODN (10 nmol) was treated with 2 U of nuclease P1 (US Biological Inc., Swampscott, MA) and 0.03 U of phosphodiesterase II (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in a 100 mul solution containing 50 mM sodium acetate (NaOAc), 30 mM NaCl and 1.0 mM ZnSO4 (pH 5.0).
After being incubated at 37 C for 12 h, the solution was kept at room temperature for another 12 h.
The digestion mixture was dried and dissolved in 50 mul water, to the resulting solution were then added 5 mul Tris-HCl (500 mM, pH 8.5), 4 mul CIP solution (10 U/mul, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and 1 mul solution of phosphodiesterase I (0.1 U/mul; Sigma-Aldrich).
The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 12 h, and at room temperature for another 12 h.
The digestion mixture was dried, redissolved in water (100 mul) and extracted with an equal volume of chloroform; the aqueous layer was again dried and redissolved in water for LC-MS and MS/MS analyses.
As shown in the Results, some digestions were also performed with nuclease P1 and CIP only, and the experimental conditions were the same as described above, except that no phosphodiesterase and no buffer solution were added.
A self-complementary ODN [(mCG)7: d(mCGmCGmCGmCGmCGmCGmCG)] (30 nmol) was annealed under similar conditions as described above, and the ODN solution was diluted to 1.5 ml with a buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM phosphate (pH 7.0).
The resulting solution was dispersed in a Pyrex tube and degassed by three cycles of freeze-pump-thaw.
The tube with the ODN solution was then filled with high-purity argon and exposed to a Mark I 137Cs Irradiator (JL Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA) at a dose rate of 2.0 Gy/min for 3 h (total dose: 360 Gy).
The resulting solution was dried by the Speed-vac, desalted and digested with enzymes as described above for the UV-irradiation mixture.
Experiments under aerobic conditions were carried out in a similar fashion, except that no freeze-pump-thaw procedure was applied.
On the other hand, the solution was bubbled with oxygen for 30 min before irradiation for experiments under saturated oxygen conditions.
Off-line HPLC separations were performed on a system composed of a Hitachi L-6200A pump (Hitachi Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), a HP-1050 UV detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and a Peak Simple Chromatography Data System (SRI Instruments Inc., Las Vegas, NV).
A 4.6 x 250 mm Apollo C18 column (5 mum in particle size and 300 A in pore size; Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL) was used for the separation.
A solution of 50 mM TEAA (solution A) and a 50 mM TEAA/acetonitrile mixture (70/30, v/v, solution B) were used as the mobile phases, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min.
We used a gradient of 0-20% B (0-5 min) and 20-45% B (5-50 min) for the purification of radical precursor-containing ODNs.
Appropriate fractions were evaporated to dryness and redissolved in doubly distilled water for desalting by HPLC.
The desalting was carried out by using a reverse-phase C18 column (10 x 250 mm, 5 mum in particle size and 300 A in pore size; Varian, Walnut Creek, CA).
After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with water for 25 min and the sample was eluted from the column by 50% methanol in water.
A gradient (0-5 min, 0-20% B; 5-40 min, 20-40% B) was used for the separation of the UV-C irradiation products of single-stranded radical precursor-containing ODNs.
The enzymatic digestion products of the UV-C irradiation mixture of radical precursor-containing ODN were separated by employing the same buffer solutions and the gradient was 0-40 min, 0-30% B; 40-50 min, 30-60% B.
The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the effluents were monitored by UV detection at 260 nm.
Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and MS/MS experiments were carried out on an LCQ Deca XP ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA).
An equal-volume solvent mixture of acetonitrile and water was used as the solvent for electrospray, and a 2 mul aliquot of ~5 muM sample solution was injected in each run.
The spray voltages were 4.0 and 3.4 kV for experiments in the positive- and negative-ion modes, respectively.
The capillary temperature was maintained at 150 C.
The separation was carried out by using a 0.50 x 150 mm Zorbax SB-C18 column with a particle size of 5 mum (Agilent Technologies), and an Agilent 1100 capillary HPLC pump was employed.
The flow rate was 6.0 mul/min, and a 120 min gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 20 mM ammonium acetate was used.
The flow from capillary LC column was directed to the LCQ Deca XP ion-trap mass spectrometer.
The mass spectrometer was set up to monitor the fragmentation of the [M+H]+ ions of the cross-link lesion (m/z 569) or other ions as indicated in Results.
The phosphoramidite building block of 4-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-5-(phenylthiomethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine was prepared following the recently published procedures.
By employing this building block and traditional solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry, we synthesized d(ACGTGYCGTGAT), d(ACGTGCYGTGAT) and d(CCGYCGGC) (Y represents 5-phenylthiomethyl-2'-deoxycytidine, Scheme 1).
There is no apparent difference in coupling efficiency between radical precursor-containing phosphoramidite building block and conventional phosphoramidites that were used in the solid-phase synthesis.
The molecular masses of the above three ODNs were measured by ESI-MS to be 3784.0, 3784.0 and 2494.0 Da, respectively, which are in accord with the corresponding calculated average masses of 3783.6, 3783.6 and 2493.8 Da.
Moreover, the sequences of the ODNs were confirmed by the product-ion spectra (MS/MS) of the [M-3H]3- ions of these oligomers [data shown in Supplementary Figures S2, S3 and S10, nomenclature for fragment ions follows that of McLuckey et al. ].
Our previous studies showed that a major product emanating from the 254 nm irradiation of d(GY) and d(YG) is an intrastrand cross-link lesion, in which the methyl carbon atom of 5-methylcytosine and the C8 carbon atom of the neighboring guanine are covalently bonded.
To examine whether the cross-link lesion can also be generated in ODNs, we irradiated radical precursor-containing ODNs under anaerobic conditions and separated the resulting products by HPLC.
(The HPLC traces for the separations of d(ACGTGYCGTGAT) before and after UV irradiation are shown in Figure 1a and b, respectively.)
Several lines of evidence show that the fraction eluting at 22.8 min is a 12mer ODN containing a cross-link lesion at GmC site.
First, ESI-MS result (Supplementary Figure S1b) showed that this lesion has a deconvoluted mass of 3673.2 Da, which is consistent with the calculated average mass of the expected G  mC cross-link-bearing ODN (3673.4 Da).
Second, the site of cross-link can be established from the product-ion spectrum of the [M-3H]3- ion (m/z 1223.5) of the ODN without ambiguity.
Upon collisional activation in a mass spectrometer, an ODN undergoes cleavages at the N-glycosidic bond and the 3' C-O bond of the same nucleotide to yield [an-base] and wn ions.
The cleavage was proposed to be initiated from a proton transfer process.
Because of the low proton affinity of thymine, chain cleavage at the 3' side of thymidine is less commonly observed.
The production of two complementary pairs of ions, i.e. [a5-G]-/[w7 + G]2- and  (Figure 2a), demonstrates that the guanine at the fifth position is covalently linked with 5-methylcytosine at the sixth position because a6 and [w7 + G] ions can only be produced when the two nucleobases are cross-linked (Figure 2b).
Similar types of characteristic fragment ions have been observed previously in the product-ion spectra of deprotonated ions of ODNs containing a GC cross-link or a dimeric DNA photoproduct.
To establish whether this is the same G  mC cross-link lesion as what was identified previously, we digested the lesion-containing 12mer (the 22.8 min fraction as shown in Figure 1b) with nuclease P1 and CIP and subjected the resulting digestion mixture to HPLC analysis.
We determined that the fraction eluting at 36.8 min (Figure 3a) is the d(G  mC) cross-link lesion that we identified previously because this fraction not only co-elutes with the d(G  mC) standard (Figure 3b) but also exhibits the same MS and MS/MS as the standard d(G  mC) (data not shown).
It is worth noting that, under this enzymic digestion condition, the phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of the G  mC cross-link appears to be completely cleaved (vide infra).
We further determined the yield for the formation of the G  mC lesion by LC-MS/MS.
In this respect, two types of external standards were employed: one is the enzymic digestion product of d(ACGTG  mCCGTGAT), which gave a yield of 11%; the other is d(G  mC) formed from the 254 nm irradiation of d(GY), offering a yield of 8.6% [Table 1, LC-MS/MS results for the analysis of standard d(mC  G) and d(G  mC) are shown in Figure 4, and calibration curves are shown in Supplementary Figures S4 and S5].
We expect that the yield coming from the analysis with the ODN as standard is more accurate than that with the d(G  mC) as standard because identical experimental procedures (enzymic digestion, chloroform extraction, etc.) were employed for the sample and the ODN standard.
In addition, we assumed that the extinction coefficient of the cross-linked nucleobase portion is the sum of those of the unmodified dC and dG, which may introduce more error in determining the concentration for the d(G  mC) than for the ODN, d(ACGTG  mCCGTGAT), by UV absorbance measurement.
Bearing in mind that radical I can also couple readily with molecular oxygen and that the resulting peroxyl radical can be transformed to give single-nucleobase lesions, i.e. 5-formylcytosine and 5-(hydroxymethyl)cytosine (Scheme 2), we next examined whether radical I can also result in the formation of the G  mC under aerobic conditions.
LC-MS/MS quantification showed that the 254 nm irradiation of d(ACGTGYCGTGAT) can indeed give rise to the formation of G  mC, though the yield is markedly reduced comparing with that under anaerobic conditions.
[Table 1, the yield decreased from 11 to 0.68% while the enzymic digestion mixture of d(ACGTG  mCCGTGAT) was used as external standard for quantification.]
The other two HPLC fractions (20.9 and 21.8 min) (Figure 1b) have the same molecular weight as the cross-link lesion-containing ODN discussed above (22.8 min fraction).
The identities of these two products remain unclear, though ESI-MS/MS results indicate that they might be intrastrand cross-link lesions where the mC is covalently linked to guanine at a distal site (ESI-MS and MS/MS results are shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7).
Similar irradiation of radical precursor-containing d(CCGYCGGC) again gave rise to a G  mC cross-link lesion (data shown in Supplementary Figures S8, S9b and S11).
We also detected the d(mC  G) from the enzymic digestion mixture (with four enzymes as stated in the Materials and Methods) of the UV-C irradiation products of d(ACGTGCYGTGAT).
The d(mC  G) induced, however, was slightly above the detection threshold of the LC-MS/MS method, which is a few femtomoles for d(mC  G) and d(G  mC) (data not shown).
The above results illustrate that the independent generation of reactive intermediate I allows for the facile generation of sufficient ODN substrates for future thermodynamic, replication, and repair studies of the G  mC cross-link lesion.
In addition, we showed that the formation of cross-link lesion between 5-methylcytosine and guanine is strongly sequence-dependent, with the GmC site being much more favorable than the mCG site.
This observation is consistent with previous studies for cross-link lesions formed between the C5 carbon atom of cytosine and the C8 carbon atom of the neighboring guanine or between the methyl carbon atom of thymine and the C8 carbon atom of the vicinal purine bases.
In this respect, the formation of cross-link lesions is much more facile at 5'-purine-pyrimidine-3' site than at 5'-pyrimidine-purine-3' site, which is attributed to that the distance between the relevant carbon atoms involved in coupling the two nucleobases is shorter at the former site than at the latter site.
To better mimic the effect of ionizing radiation on DNA damage, it is important to examine whether the independently generated radical I can also result in the formation of mC  G and G  mC in duplex DNA.
To this end, we carried out the UV-C irradiation of a duplex d(ACGTGYCGTGAT)/d(ATCACGGCACGT) under anaerobic conditions.
We tried to resolve the components in the UV-C irradiation mixture of the duplex DNA by HPLC; the lesion-bearing strand, however, co-migrates with the complementary strand on the HPLC column, preventing us from obtaining pure single-stranded ODNs for further characterizations.
To circumvent this, we digested the duplex irradiation mixture with enzymes (i.e. nuclease P1, CIP and two phosphodiesterases) and subjected the resulting digestion mixtures to LC-MS/MS analysis.
The LC-MS/MS results clearly showed that the G  mC cross-link lesion can be induced from the independently generated radical in a duplex environment.
In this respect, the selected-ion chromatogram (SIC), which monitors the m/z 569 275 transition, for the analysis of enzymic digestion products of the UV-C irradiation mixture showed a peak at similar retention time as the peak observed in the corresponding SIC for the analysis of authentic d(G  mC) (data not shown).
Furthermore, we quantified the G  mC cross-link lesion from the peak areas in SIC, and it turned out that the yields for the formation of the G  mC cross-link lesion are 2.0 and 0.44% under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively (Table 1).
The yield is again higher under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions.
Moreover, we carried out a similar irradiation where the solution is constantly bubbled with molecular oxygen during irradiation, and we determined that the yield for the formation of the G  mC lesion is 0.13% under this condition (Table 1; LC-MS/MS results are shown in Supplementary Figure S12).
The LC-MS/MS result shows that, under anaerobic conditions, the formation of the G  mC cross-link lesion from the independently generated I is less efficient in double- than in single-stranded ODNs.
This observation is in drastic contrast with the formation of cross-link lesion from the Pyrex-filtered UV light irradiation of 5-bromocytosine-containing duplex ODN, in which the formation of cross-link lesion in double-stranded DNA is much more efficient.
The exact reason for this is not clear.
One possibility is that the bulky phenylthio moiety, which is present in the major groove of duplex DNA, may compromise the local base stacking.
Therefore, the 5-phenylthiomethyl group may predispose the radical I in a position that is not ideal for coupling with the C8 carbon atom of the neighboring guanine.
Prompted by that several other intrastrand cross-link lesions have been found in the gamma irradiation mixture of duplex DNA and that the mC  G cross-link can be induced from the gamma irradiation of d(mCG), we first exploited whether gamma irradiation can result in the formation of the mC  G and G  mC cross-link lesions in duplex ODNs.
To this end, we irradiated a self-complementary ODN, d(mCG)7, under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
We then digested the irradiation mixture with four enzymes (i.e. nuclease P1, CIP and two phosphodiesterases) or with only two enzymes (nuclease P1 and CIP) and subjected the resulting products to LC-MS/MS analysis.
We chose those four enzymes because they have been used by Bellon et al.
for the release of the structurally related intrastrand cross-link lesions from duplex DNA.
In addition, previous studies showed that nuclease P1 cannot cleave the phosphodiester bonds 3' to both photomodified nucleobases in ODNs containing a dimeric DNA photoproduct.
Along this line, thymine glycol was shown to block the cleavage of its 3' side phosphodiester bond.
The failure in cleavages of the phosphodiester bonds was attributed to that the bulky photoproduct or thymine glycol cannot be fit into the active site of nuclease P1.
Considering that either or both of the two phosphodiester bonds on the 3' side of the two modified nucleobases (i.e. mC and G) are not susceptible to nuclease P1 cleavage and that CIP removes the 5'-terminal phosphate group(s), we expect that nuclease P1 and CIP treatment will give four possible products for a mC  G- or G  mC-containing ODN (Scheme 3).
Here, we examined rigorously whether the two phosphodiester bonds are susceptible to cleavage under the two- or four-enzyme digestion conditions by monitoring all eight possible digestion products with LC-MS/MS [Scheme 3 and Supplementary Figures S13-S15; note that d(G  mC) and d(mC  G) have the same m/z values for their protonated ions, so are the d(G  mC)
+ 2H2O-H3PO4 and d(mC  G) + 2H2O - H3PO4].
The LC-MS/MS results showed that among the eight potential digestion products that we monitored, d(G  mC) (1, Scheme 3, m/z 569) is the major product resulting from the digestion with all four enzymes.
We can also detect a small quantity of the dinucleoside product (2, Scheme 3, m/z 507), whereas neither the trinucleoside diphosphate (3, Scheme 3, m/z 898) nor the trinucleoside monophosphate (4, Scheme 3, m/z 836) is detectable under this digestion condition (Supplementary Figure S15).
Likewise, we were not able to detect trinucleoside diphosphate or trinucleoside monophosphate for the lesions formed at mC  G site (5, m/z 872 and 6, m/z 810, Scheme 3).
This result demonstrates that G  mC can be induced from gamma irradiation under anaerobic conditions.
Moreover, the phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of the lesion is completely hydrolyzed while all four enzymes are employed.
In addition, the presence of a peak in the SIC for the m/z 507 275 transition indicates that a small portion of the internal phosphodiester bond (<5%) might also be hydrolyzed under this enzymic digestion condition, though we cannot exclude the possibility that the dinucleoside product is formed from an interstrand crosslink.
Leaving out phosphodiesterases I and II, however, results in incomplete digestion of the phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of the mC  G lesion, which give rise to the formation of the trinucleoside diphosphate 5 and trinucleoside monphosphate 6 (Scheme 3).
This is represented by the presence of peaks in the SICs for the m/z 872 747 and m/z 810 685 transitions (both pathways correspond to the loss of a 5-methylcytosine, Supplementary Figure S13); the identities of compounds 5 and 6 are supported by the product-ion spectra of the ions of m/z 872 and 810 (Supplementary Figure S14).
From these results, all quantitative measurements reported in this paper were carried out by employing all four enzymes for the digestion.
Moreover, we determined that, at a dose of 360 Gy, the yields for the formation of G  mC are 470 and 47 lesions per 106 GmC sites under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively
[Table 1: SICs for the m/z 569 275 transitions for the analyses of the enzymic digestion products of d(mCG)7 under different irradiation conditions are shown in Figure 5].
With the same dose of irradiation, the yields for the production of mC  G, on the other hand, were determined to be 36 and 1 lesions per 106 mCG sites under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively (Table 1).
It should be cautioned that external standards were employed for the above quantitative measurements, and more accurate results for the absolute yields should be determined by LC-MS/MS method with isotope-labeled internal standards.
Nevertheless, the relative yields for the formation of the G  mC cross-link lesion under various irradiation conditions should be reasonably accurate.
To establish the relative contributions of radical I in the two pathways outlined in Scheme 3 (i.e. coupling with O2 or its neighboring guanine base), it is important to compare the amounts of intrastrand cross-link and single-base lesions initiated from radical I under aerobic conditions.
In this respect, we attempted to carry out such measurements by LC-MS/MS.
Unfortunately, 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine is poorly resolved on two types of reverse-phase columns that we tested.
In addition, the 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine coelutes with some unknown compound(s).
Without authentic stable isotope-labeled single-base lesions, the LC-MS/MS method is not reliable for the determination of the amounts of the two single-base lesions formed from gamma irradiation.
We are now in the process of synthesizing such labeled compounds, and the results from those studies will be reported in due course.
The sequence-selective formation of the cross-link lesions can again be explained from that the distance between the methyl carbon atom of mC and the C8 carbon of its neighboring guanine is shorter in GmC sequence than in mCG sequence.
The lower yield for the formation of the cross-link lesion under aerobic conditions is not surprising again because the methyl radical of 5-methylcytosine can also couple with molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl radical (Scheme 2, II).
The formation of the cross-link lesion under aerobic conditions shows that the coupling of reactive intermediate I to its neighboring 5' guanine base is in competition with its coupling to molecular oxygen (Scheme 2).
In support of this argument, we showed that the yield for the formation of G  mC is apparently lower while the ODN solution is saturated with molecular oxygen before gamma irradiation (Table 1).
Owing to the limitation of the 137Cs source, we were not able to bubble the irradiation solution with air or molecular oxygen.
It is reasonable to expect that the molecular oxygen is partially consumed during the gamma irradiation process.
We, however, believe that it is very unlikely for the solution to be completely depleted of oxygen during the course of irradiation.
Moreover, our above results for the UV irradiation under constant O2 bubbling conditions demonstrate conclusively that the G  mC lesion can be formed under saturated O2 conditions (vide supra).
We synthesized ODNs containing a site-specifically incorporated 5-phenylthiomethyl-2'-deoxycytidine, which, upon UV-C irradiation, releases the 5-(2'-deoxycytidyl)methyl radical in these ODNs.
We also examined the reactivities of the independently generated radical through product analysis.
Our results showed that the G  mC cross-link lesion was formed more efficiently in single-stranded ODN than in duplex ODN upon UV-C irradiation.
Furthermore, the efficiency for cross-linking is highly sequence-dependent.
The G  mC lesion can be formed at a much higher yield than the mC  G lesion.
Previous work by Bellon et al. showed that the analogous intrastrand cross-link lesion can be generated in d(GTG) and d(ATA) sequences from the UV-C irradiation of the corresponding precursor of 5-(2'-deoxyuridyl)-5-methyl radical.
The results presented in this paper, however, demonstrated for the first time that the phenylthiolate-bearing nucleoside can facilitate the generation of pure, sufficient and well-characterized lesion-containing ODN substrates that can be readily used for examining the thermodynamic, replication and repair studies of the G  mC lesion.
We also found that the same G  mC cross-link lesion can be induced from the gamma irradiation of GmC-containing duplex ODN under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions; the yield for the formation of cross-link lesion in anoxic solution is ~10 times higher than that in oxygenated solution.
The respective mC  G cross-link lesion is formed with a yield that is >10-fold lower than the G  mC lesion under anaerobic conditions.
To our knowledge, the formation of intrastrand oxidative cross-link lesion under aerobic conditions has never been shown previously.
This result demonstrated that the coupling of reactive intermediate I with the neighboring guanine base can compete with its coupling to molecular oxygen, suggesting that this kind of lesion might be induced in cellular DNA by endogenous and/or exogenous ROS.
Therefore, this kind of cross-link lesion may contribute significantly to the cytotoxic effect of ROS.
This study, together with previous investigations by Box, Cadet and us, demonstrates clearly that a single pyrimidine base radical is sufficient for inducing the formation of intrastrand cross-link lesions.
This type of chemistry has been shown for all three types of secondary radicals formed from hydroxyl radical attack on pyridimine bases, i.e. the 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydropyrimid-6-yl, the 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydropyrimid-5-yl and the 5-(pyrimidyl)methyl radicals.
In this respect, the methyl radical of thymine or 5-methylcytosine can couple with its neighboring purine bases to give intrastrand cross-link lesions.
In addition, Box and co-workers identified a CG cross-link lesion from the gamma irradiation of d(CGTA) under anaerobic conditions, and the lesion was proposed to be initiated from the dehydration of the coupling product between 6-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrocytosin-5-yl radical and guanine.
We showed recently that gamma irradiation of duplex DNA can induce the formation of this kind of lesion at 5'-GC-3', but not at 5'-CG-3' site.
Moreover, we showed recently that both the 5S and 5R diastereomers of the 5-hydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidin-6-yl radical can couple with the C8 carbon atom of its 3' neighboring guanine to give cross-link lesions.
The demonstration of the formation of the mC  G cross-link lesion in duplex DNA suggests that the lesion may contribute to the mCG TT tandem double mutation observed recently.
In addition, among the six major mutational hotspots in human p53 gene (codons 175, 213, 245, 248, 273 and 282, which all contain methylated CpGs), cytosines in two of those codons, i.e. codons 175 (CGC) and 273 (CGT), have a 5' flanking guanine (the last base in codon 272 is a guanine).
Therefore, the G  mC lesion, which forms at a much higher yield than the mC  G lesion, may also contribute to CpG mutagenesis.
It is worth noting that, because of the absence of the methyl group, radical I cannot be generated on an unmethylated cytosine, underscoring the potential importance of cytosine methylation in intrastrand cross-link lesion formation and high mutation frequency observed at CpG sites.
To further explore this possibility, we will need to demonstrate the formation of this lesion in vivo and to examine the mutagenic properties of this lesion.
In this respect, the availability of the authentic G  mC lesion in both dinucleoside monophosphate and ODNs facilitates these studies.
